# Delivery

Implementation plan, compatibility policy, build sequence, and test strategy.

## Implementation Language

**Python** for the Claude-side control plane.

Rationale:

- Matches the repo's existing plugin and test conventions.
- The existing hook ecosystem is Python-heavy.
- stdio JSON-RPC, process supervision, and worktree orchestration are straightforward in `asyncio`.
- The external Codex runtime remains the supported Rust implementation from the Codex CLI.

## Compatibility Policy

### Version Pinning

Baseline version: `codex-cli 0.117.0`.

| Concept | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Tested baseline | `0.117.0` | Vendored schema was generated from this version |
| Minimum accepted | `0.117.0` | Startup rejects versions below this floor |

The executable source of truth is `server/codex_compat.py`. This section describes the policy; the code enforces it.

### Version Upgrade Workflow

1. Install the target Codex CLI version.
2. Run `scripts/regenerate_schema.sh <new-version>`.
3. Update `TESTED_CODEX_VERSION` and `MINIMUM_CODEX_VERSION` in `server/codex_compat.py`.
4. Run contract tests: `uv run pytest tests/test_codex_compat.py -v`.
5. Run integration tests: `uv run pytest tests/test_codex_compat_live.py -v`.
6. Commit the vendored schema and code changes together.

### Required and Optional Methods

The vendored schema defines which methods are required vs optional. Contract tests verify the vendored schema contains all of them.

| Tier | Methods | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Required | `thread/start`, `thread/resume`, `thread/fork`, `thread/read`, `turn/start`, `turn/interrupt` | Must be present in vendored schema. Verified by contract tests. |
| Optional | `turn/steer` | Should be present. Availability recorded at startup for runtime feature gating. |

Code paths that use optional methods must check capability at runtime via `CompatCheckResult.has_capability()` and degrade cleanly if absent. `turn/steer` remains optional after T3: v1 post-promotion advisory coherence uses stale-context marking plus next-turn context injection in the control plane.

### Startup Checks

Startup checks are implemented incrementally across build steps:

| Check | Implemented In | Method | Failure Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| `codex` binary present | T1 (codex_compat) | PATH lookup | Plugin refuses to start |
| Version floor met | T1 (codex_compat) | `codex --version` (semver parsed) | Plugin refuses to start |
| App Server initialize handshake succeeds | Build step 1 (JSON-RPC client) | `initialize` JSON-RPC call | Plugin refuses to start |
| Required methods present | Build step 1 (JSON-RPC client) | Capability probe during handshake | Plugin refuses to start |
| Optional methods present | Build step 1 (JSON-RPC client) | Same probe | Warn, record in `codex.status` |

T1 implements the version-floor check. The version floor plus vendored-schema contract tests are sufficient for the baseline: if the installed version meets the floor, and the contract tests prove the vendored schema for that version contains all required methods, then the methods are present. The handshake and method-surface probe provide defense-in-depth and are added in Runtime Milestone R1 when the JSON-RPC client exists.

### Vendored Schema

The vendored schema bundle at `tests/fixtures/codex-app-server/<version>/` is generated by `codex app-server generate-json-schema` without `--experimental`. It is the canonical contract artifact.

- Contract tests run against vendored fixtures only (no live binary required).
- Integration tests require a live `codex` binary (version-floor check only in T1).
- A derived `required-methods.json` manifest is generated for readable assertions. The manifest is a convenience view — the vendored `ClientRequest.json` is the primary truth.

Fixture generation uses the CLI's `[experimental]` `generate-json-schema` command. This is a build-time maintenance step — no runtime dependency on experimental CLI surfaces.

### Context Assembly Implementation

[Foundations](foundations.md#context-assembly-contract) defines the normative context assembly contract. Delivery defines when the control plane implements that contract: the assembler, profile filter, redactor, trimmer, and budget enforcement are runtime behaviors added as the tool surface comes online.

Context assembly is per-call behavior, not a startup check. `codex.status` may report related diagnostics, but it does not require full prompt-packet assembly. The assembler is required for any tool that dispatches turns to Codex, including consultation, dialogue replies, and delegation start.

Runtime Milestone R1 implements the advisory-side consumption path for the v1 post-promotion coherence protocol defined in [advisory-runtime-policy.md §Post-Promotion Coherence](advisory-runtime-policy.md#post-promotion-coherence): if a stale marker exists, the next advisory turn injects a workspace-changed summary without depending on `turn/steer`. Creation of the stale marker occurs later when promotion enters scope.

### Excluded Dependencies

The following are not used for core functionality in v1:

| Feature | Reason |
|---|---|
| WebSocket transport | Experimental |
| Dynamic tools | Experimental |
| `plugin/list`, `plugin/read`, `plugin/install`, `plugin/uninstall` | Not needed for core flows |
| Other experimental APIs | Stability not guaranteed |

## Recommended Build Sequence

Build the smallest slice that proves the architecture without recreating the old plugin.

### Milestones and Delivery Steps

Delivery Steps are the numbered rows in the table below. Runtime Milestones are named `R1`, `R2`, and so on, and define scope-freezing checkpoints across one or more delivery steps.

Runtime Milestone `R1` is the first runtime-bearing milestone. It is not identical to Delivery Step 1 (`codex.status`): it spans the smallest coherent subset of delivery work needed to prove live advisory runtime bring-up and one-shot consultation without reopening the resolved T2/T3 design decisions.

| Step | Component | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `codex.status` | App Server connection, auth, version check |
| 2 | `codex.consult` | Advisory runtime, prompt builder, context assembler/profile filter, thread lifecycle |
| 3 | Lineage store | Persistent collaboration handle tracking |
| 4 | `codex.dialogue.start` + `.reply` + `.read` | Advisory runtime, lineage store, thread management, context assembler/profile filter |
| 5 | Hook guard | Secret scanning, path validation, policy checks, final packet validation (post-assembly) |
| 6 | `codex.delegate.start` | Execution runtime, worktree manager, isolation, context assembler/profile filter |
| 7 | `codex.delegate.poll` + `.decide` + `.promote` | [Promotion protocol](promotion-protocol.md), [operation journal](recovery-and-journal.md#operation-journal) |

### Official Plugin Equivalents

| Build step | Official plugin equivalent |
|---|---|
| `codex.status` | Version and health checks are present |
| `codex.consult` | Native review and thread utilities cover the closest baseline flow |
| Lineage store | No equivalent |
| Dialogue surface | No equivalent durable dialogue contract |
| Hook guard | No `PreToolUse` enforcement equivalent |
| `codex.delegate.start` | Same-checkout task execution exists, but not isolated execution |
| `codex.delegate.poll` + `.decide` + `.promote` | No promotion-gated equivalent |

Steps with no official-plugin equivalent are the core value proposition of this spec's extension architecture.

### Runtime Milestone R1

**In scope**

- JSON-RPC client and runtime bootstrap sufficient for advisory runtime bring-up
- Live runtime health verification: auth status, `initialize` handshake, required-method probe, optional-method recording, and `codex.status`
- Prompt builder and context assembly contract implementation: assembler, profile filter, redactor, trimmer, budget enforcement, and `context_size` audit measurement
- One-shot `codex.consult` through the read-only advisory runtime, including the minimum thread/turn lifecycle required for consultation
- Structured consult result projection back to Claude
- Advisory-side consumption of the post-promotion coherence protocol: if a `stale_advisory_context` marker is already present, the next advisory turn injects a workspace-changed summary and clears the marker after successful dispatch

**Deferred**

- Full `codex.dialogue.*` surface and persistent lineage management
- Delegation runtime, worktree orchestration, and promotion, including creation of the `stale_advisory_context` marker on successful promotion
- Automatic post-promotion thread fork
- `turn/steer`-based coherence
- Hook guard integration as a required end-to-end enforcement gate

**Acceptance gates**

- `codex.status` reports version, auth status, and required/optional method availability from a live runtime
- Advisory runtime bring-up fails closed when auth is unavailable, `initialize` fails, or required methods are missing
- `codex.consult` executes an advisory turn end-to-end in the read-only advisory runtime and returns the structured result shape defined by the consult flow
- Context packets obey the normative assembly contract, enforce budget caps before dispatch, and record `context_size`
- If a `stale_advisory_context` marker is present before an advisory turn, the next advisory turn injects the workspace-changed summary and clears the marker after successful dispatch
- No R1 path depends on `turn/steer`, automatic thread fork, delegation, or promotion

### Runtime Milestone R2 (Dialogue Foundation)

R2 implements the lineage store (delivery step 3) and the minimum dialogue surface (delivery step 4, minus fork). It also introduces MCP server scaffolding for tool exposure and dialogue operation journaling.

**In scope**

- Lineage store implementation per [contracts.md §Lineage Store](contracts.md#lineage-store): session-partitioned append-only JSONL at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/lineage/<claude_session_id>/`, crash-safe semantics, lifecycle management, and advisory runtime rotation mapping
- MCP server scaffolding (`mcp_server.py`): tool registration and serialized request dispatch for all R2 tools plus existing R1 capabilities (`codex.status`, `codex.consult`). **Serialization invariant:** the control plane processes one tool call at a time; concurrent MCP requests are queued, not processed in parallel
- `codex.dialogue.start`: create a durable dialogue thread in the advisory runtime, persist handle in lineage store, return [Dialogue Start](contracts.md#dialogue-start) response shape
- `codex.dialogue.reply`: continue a dialogue turn on an existing handle, dispatch via advisory runtime using the same context assembly pipeline as consultation, return [Dialogue Reply](contracts.md#dialogue-reply) response shape
- `codex.dialogue.read`: read dialogue state for a given `collaboration_id` from lineage store data plus Codex `thread/read`, return [Dialogue Read](contracts.md#dialogue-read) response shape
- Operation journal entries for all dispatched dialogue operations: journal-before-dispatch per [recovery-and-journal.md §Write Ordering](recovery-and-journal.md#write-ordering). `dialogue.start` uses thread-creation idempotency key (`claude_session_id` + `collaboration_id`); `dialogue.reply` uses turn-dispatch key (`runtime_id` + `thread_id` + `turn_sequence`). See [§Idempotency Keys](recovery-and-journal.md#idempotency-keys). Trim on completion.
- Audit events for `dialogue_turn` with required fields per [recovery-and-journal.md §Write Triggers](recovery-and-journal.md#write-triggers): `collaboration_id`, `runtime_id`, `turn_id`
- Context assembly reuse: dialogue turns use the same advisory profile, assembler, redactor, trimmer, and budget caps as consultation

**Deferred**

- Dialogue branching via `seed_from` on `codex.dialogue.start` (copy-and-diverge, not tree-structured) — see [decisions.md §Dialogue Fork Scope](decisions.md#dialogue-fork-scope)
- Hook guard integration for dialogue tool calls
- Delegation runtime, worktree orchestration, and promotion
- `turn/steer`-based coherence

**Acceptance gates**

- Lineage store persists handles to disk (append-only JSONL) and recovers them after a simulated process crash within a session, including discarding incomplete trailing records
- `codex.dialogue.start` creates a fresh advisory thread and returns a valid [Dialogue Start](contracts.md#dialogue-start) response backed by a persisted handle
- `codex.dialogue.reply` dispatches a turn on an existing handle and returns a valid [Dialogue Reply](contracts.md#dialogue-reply) response
- `codex.dialogue.read` returns the current state of a dialogue matching the [Dialogue Read](contracts.md#dialogue-read) shape, from lineage store data plus Codex thread history
- MCP server exposes all R2 tools (`codex.dialogue.start`, `.reply`, `.read`) plus R1 tools (`codex.status`, `codex.consult`) with serialized dispatch
- Dialogue turns are journaled before dispatch and replayed idempotently after simulated crash
- Audit events are emitted for dialogue turns with required fields
- No R2 path depends on fork, delegation, promotion, or hook guard enforcement

### R1/R2 Historical Deployment Profile

Original R1/R2 rollout target (superseded by post-R2 implementation):

- Implemented surface: `codex.status`, `codex.consult`, `codex.dialogue.start`, `codex.dialogue.reply`, `codex.dialogue.read`
- Deployment shape: MCP server launched from the repo checkout; not a packaged plugin artifact
- Operational assumptions: serialized MCP dispatch, read-only advisory runtime, no advisory widening, no delegation/promotion path, no hook-guard enforcement
- Out of scope for this rollout target: packaged-plugin structure, delegation/execution components, promotion wiring, and broader production hardening gates
- Risk acceptance for remaining R1/R2 parked debt lives in `docs/tickets/closed-tickets/2026-03-27-r1-carry-forward-debt.md`

### Current Dev-Repo Deployment Profile (2026-04-29)

Current implemented rollout target: **dev-repo internal use**, deployed as a Claude Code plugin via the `turbo-mode` marketplace bundle (not a bare MCP server from repo checkout).

- Implemented MCP surface:
  - `codex.status`
  - `codex.consult`
  - `codex.dialogue.start`
  - `codex.dialogue.reply`
  - `codex.dialogue.read`
  - `codex.delegate.start`
  - `codex.delegate.poll`
  - `codex.delegate.decide`
  - `codex.delegate.promote`
  - `codex.delegate.discard`
- Deployment shape: packaged Claude Code plugin installed via marketplace; MCP server runs as a plugin subprocess, not from repo checkout
- Operational assumptions: serialized MCP dispatch, advisory runtime (read-only) for consult/dialogue, execution runtime (worktree-isolated) for delegation, operator-gated approval loop for delegation escalations, promotion-gated artifact application
- Delegation sandbox policy: `workspaceWrite` with worktree-only writable/readable roots, `includePlatformDefaults: True` (Candidate A), `networkAccess: False`

### Post-R2 Supersession Packets

Post-R2 work is decomposed into the following execution packets:

| Packet | Ticket | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 2a | `T-20260330-02` | Plugin shell, minimal packaged consult flow, `codex.status` integration |
| 2b | `T-20260330-03` | Shared safety substrate, profiles, learnings, analytics emission, benchmark contract |
| 3 | `T-20260330-04` | Dialogue parity and context-injection retirement decision |
| 4 | `T-20260330-05` | Execution-domain foundation |
| 5 | `T-20260330-06` | Promotion flow and delegate UX |
| 6/7 | `T-20260330-07` | Analytics skill, review skill, migration, and cutover |

After packet `2b` is stable, packets `3` and `4` may proceed in parallel.
Dialogue is the adoption gate. The execution domain is the completion gate.

The context-injection retirement decision is governed by
[dialogue-supersession-benchmark.md](dialogue-supersession-benchmark.md).

### Not in First Slice

- Analytics
- Codex-side plugin discovery
- Generalized policy editing
- Multi-job concurrency (beyond max-1)
- Three-way merge in promotion

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Control plane routing logic
- Policy fingerprint computation (comparison across rotation boundaries is future-scope — see [advisory-runtime-policy.md §Future-Scope: Freeze-and-Rotate Design](advisory-runtime-policy.md#future-scope-freeze-and-rotate-design))
- Idempotency key generation and deduplication
- Promotion precondition checks
- Promotion state machine transitions
- Typed response shape construction

### Integration Tests

- Full consultation flow through advisory runtime
- Dialogue with seeded start and read
- Delegation with worktree isolation
- Promotion with all preconditions verified
- Crash recovery from journal replay
- Advisory runtime rotation on privilege widening (future-scope — not current Packet 1 runtime behavior; see [advisory-runtime-policy.md §Future-Scope: Freeze-and-Rotate Design](advisory-runtime-policy.md#future-scope-freeze-and-rotate-design))

### Contract Tests

- Vendor the pinned App Server schema
- Verify startup handshake against the pinned version
- Test behavior with unknown/unsupported server request kinds
- Verify typed rejection responses match [contracts.md](contracts.md#typed-response-shapes) shapes
