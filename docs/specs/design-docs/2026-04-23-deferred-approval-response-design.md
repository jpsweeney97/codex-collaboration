## Overview

Redesigns the delegation runtime's control plane so that a Codex App Server turn can stay live across operator delay and receive an approval response in the same turn. Replaces the current synchronous capture-and-cancel flow with a worker-thread execution model coordinated through a resolution registry.

**Ticket:** T-20260423-02 (`docs/tickets/closed-tickets/2026-04-23-deferred-same-turn-approval-response.md`).

**Blocked (historical):** T-20260423-01 — resolved; T-01 closed 2026-04-29 at commit `6580d86e`.

**Branch:** `feature/delegate-deferred-approval-response`.

**Replaces (as rejected input):** `feature/delegate-exec-policy-amendment` at commit `edff9c07`. Decisions D7, D8, D10 from that spec are superseded by this document. D1–D6, D9, D11, D12 survive from the rejected spec and would apply to any future amendment-admission work, not to this document.

## Scope and Non-Goals

### In scope

1. `codex.delegate.start` call-path redesign — return semantics while the original turn stays live.
2. Background turn execution model — worker thread per deferred-approval turn.
3. Capture cardinality — single-parked-at-a-time with proof-by-construction from the serial handler loop.
4. Resolution registry — blocking-wait-and-signal mechanism between main thread and worker.
5. Persisted request / job state — new fields, mutators, cold-start reconciliation.
6. Public contract updates — `DelegationDecisionResult` shape, `contracts.md`, model enums.
7. Timeout policy — operator window as local abandonment budget.
8. Recovery semantics — orphan demotion + journal provenance annotation.

### Non-goals

- **Amendment admission** — not currently required for the observed canonical delegation flow (per the diagnostic run record). If revisited, would stack on this packet's primitives.
- **Eligibility logic** — what requests can be amended vs. only approved/denied. Same follow-up.
- **Generic deferred-decision framework** — amendments are the only consumer for v1. Reusability for other decision kinds is incidental, not a design driver.
- **Implementation.** This ticket closes on spec approval. Plan + code land under a separate phase.

## Named Invariants

Five invariants govern the design. Any implementation change must verify against all five.

**IO-1 (Session ownership):** The worker thread exclusively owns its `AppServerRuntimeSession` and `JsonRpcClient` for the lifetime of its turn. All JSON-RPC reads (`_next_id`, `request()`, `next_notification()`) and writes (`respond()`) happen on that thread. No other thread touches the session. Rationale: `JsonRpcClient` at `packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/jsonrpc_client.py` has no shared-client locking (`_next_id` is a bare int increment at line 40, `_notification_backlog` is an unlocked `deque`).

**IO-2 (In-memory cross-thread coordination = resolution registry only):** The resolution registry is the only *in-memory* coordination API between main (MCP dispatch) and worker. `decide()` publishes to the registry; the worker blocks on it. No other in-memory mutable state crosses threads — not the session, not the job state. The JSONL stores (`pending_request_store`, `delegation_job_store`, operation journal) are durable cross-thread observation surfaces under IO-3's single-writer discipline: main may read a store while the worker is the active writer (e.g., `poll()` reads job state during a running turn). Concurrent readers may observe a stale snapshot or skip an in-progress/invalid JSONL record; they must not treat partial JSON as a valid record — the replay paths enforce this today by swallowing `json.JSONDecodeError` (`pending_request_store.py:87`, `delegation_job_store.py:204`). IO-4 backs the durability side (fsync on writes); IO-2 governs only the in-memory coordination layer.

**IO-3 (Single-writer-per-store):** Each store has one writer thread at a time per the thread-role table (see §Runtime Architecture). Eliminates store-level locks; relies on OS append atomicity (IO-4) for correctness. The "at a time" clause is load-bearing and depends on the **singleton busy gate** at `packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/delegation_controller.py:328-349` — the max-1 user-attention job per session check that consults the job store, the runtime registry, and unresolved `job_creation` journal entries. Because at most one delegation job is in flight per session, at most one worker thread exists at any instant. Any future relaxation of the singleton constraint (parallel jobs, multi-session sharding) must revisit IO-3 either by adding store-level locking or by proving that multi-worker → single-writer-per-store still holds under the new partitioning.

Within a single job's lifecycle, single-writer-per-store further requires that main-thread and worker-thread writes to the same store never overlap. Packet 1 preserves this by construction:

- **`delegation_job_store`:** worker writes end with the terminal-status persistence via `_persist_job_transition` (worker's last write for that job). Main-thread `poll()` may subsequently write `update_artifacts` via `_load_or_materialize_inspection` at `delegation_controller.py:870-899`, but this path is gated on `job.status in ("completed", "failed", "canceled", "unknown")` at `:873` (the `"canceled"` literal is added by C1-A — see §JobStatus='canceled' propagation) — so these writes observe a frozen terminal job with no concurrent worker writes. For `"canceled"` specifically, `_load_or_materialize_inspection` returns `None` without calling `update_artifacts` (canceled jobs have no artifacts — the worker was interrupted before they could be produced), so the main-thread-write-to-terminal-job case never fires for `"canceled"`.
- **Operation journal:** `approval_resolution.intent` has two writer contexts — main (operator-decide path) and worker (non-operator wake paths: timeout-wake and internal-abort-wake). The `ResolutionRegistry.reserve()` CAS is the gate that ensures exactly one of them wins per `request_id` for the operator/timeout races; the losing caller receives `None` from `reserve()` and writes nothing. The internal-abort wake is gated by `signal_internal_abort`'s atomic `awaiting → aborted` transition (see §Internal abort coordination), which likewise guarantees at most one winner per `request_id`. The surviving winner's `intent` write therefore has no concurrent writer. `approval_resolution.dispatched` and `.completed` are always worker-only.
- **`pending_request_store`:** worker-only. Main reads during validation in `decide()` and projection in `poll()`; does not write.

**IO-4 (Inherited JSONL append — DURABLE journal writes):** The operation journal and stores that gate recovery correctness — `journal.write_phase` at `packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/journal.py:300-307`, `pending_request_store._append` at `:71-75`, `delegation_job_store._append` — use `open("a")` + single-line JSON write + **`flush()` + `os.fsync()`**. The fsync is load-bearing: these writes survive process crash. The repo already depends on this pattern being correct under its single-writer discipline on supported platforms (Linux/macOS). This spec extends the operation journal to two writers (main writes `approval_resolution.intent` via `decide()`; worker writes `approval_resolution.dispatched/completed`); we inherit the platform assumption, we do not prove it. If a future change adds multi-process concurrent writers or Windows support, upgrade to an explicit lock or hardened append primitive.

**IO-5 (Audit events are best-effort, NOT durable):** `journal.append_audit_event` at `packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/journal.py:241-245` is `open("a")` + single-line JSON write — **no `flush()`, no `os.fsync()`**. Audit events may be lost on process crash between the `write()` call and the OS eventually flushing the page cache. The same applies to `append_outcome` (`:261-265`) and `append_delegation_outcome` (`:281-285`). Concrete consequence for this design: audit-event appends MUST NOT sit inside any critical section that gates worker wake or durable state transitions. An audit failure is survivable (log + continue); an operation-journal failure is not. This is why the transactional registry protocol (see §Transactional registry protocol) places `append_audit_event` AFTER `commit_signal`, not before.

**OB-1 (Observation honesty):** Every durable field and audit event reflects only what the plugin locally observed. Transport-level observations use transport verbs (dispatched, succeeded, failed). Turn-level observations use turn verbs (completed, interrupted). The plugin does not claim semantic application of an operator decision by App Server, because it has no channel to verify that claim.

## Runtime Architecture and Thread Ownership

### Current (synchronous) architecture — what breaks

```
MCP caller ──► start() ──► _execute_live_turn() ─────────────── [blocks]
                               │
                               ├─ run_execution_turn(handler)
                               │     └─ handler captures request → interrupt_turn()
                               │
                               ├─ turn ends
                               ├─ _finalize_turn() → build DelegationEscalation
                               └─ return escalation
```

The escalation cannot surface until the turn is already interrupted. `decide()` has nothing live to respond to — the request handler has returned and is unreachable.

Evidence:
- `start()` synchronous return at `packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/delegation_controller.py:618-624`.
- `DelegationEscalation` constructed only post-turn inside `_finalize_turn` at `delegation_controller.py:1504-1510`.

### New (worker-thread) architecture

                                                         loop → next notification
                                                         ...
                                                         turn/completed

### Thread roles and ownership

| Thread | Spawned by | Lifetime | Session | Store writes | Store reads |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Main (MCP dispatch) | Plugin process | Plugin process | Read-only (via controller helpers) | `delegation_job_store.create` (via `start()` only); `delegation_job_store.update_artifacts` (via `poll()`'s `_load_or_materialize_inspection` at `:870-899`; gated to terminal jobs only by `:873` — see IO-3); `journal.write_phase(approval_resolution.intent)` (operator-decide path, gated by `reserve()` CAS); `journal.append_audit_event` | Any (read-only for poll, decide validation) |
| Worker (per-turn) | `start()` spawn | One turn (from `_execute_live_turn` entry to terminal or exception) | Exclusive owner (IO-1) | `pending_request_store` (create + mutators); `delegation_job_store.update_parked_request` + terminal status via `_persist_job_transition`; `journal.write_phase(approval_resolution.intent)` (non-operator wake paths: timeout-wake gated by `reserve()` CAS, and internal-abort-wake gated by `signal_internal_abort`'s atomic `awaiting → aborted` transition); `journal.write_phase(approval_resolution.dispatched, approval_resolution.completed)` | Own session state only |
| JSON-RPC background readers (existing) | `JsonRpcClient.start` | Per session | Queue producer only (`_message_queue` at `jsonrpc_client.py:35`) | None | None |
| Cold-start recovery (existing) | Plugin init | Plugin init | None | Demotion transitions via `_persist_job_transition` | All stores |

The two "new" threading constructs are the **worker thread** (one per in-flight deferred-approval turn) and the **resolution registry** (in-memory, lock-guarded, lifetime bounded by one turn).

### Resolution registry

In-memory structure. The registry owns two independent coordination channels:

- **Per-request channel** — a `RegistryEntry` keyed by `request_id`. States `awaiting | reserved | consuming | aborted` (see §Transactional registry protocol for the `awaiting → reserved → consuming` transitions and §Internal abort coordination for the `awaiting → aborted` transition). Used by the worker to block on a pending resolution, by `decide()` to deliver one, and by `signal_internal_abort()` to terminate a parked worker on a plugin-invariant violation.
- **Per-job start-outcome channel** — a `CaptureReadyEvent` keyed by `job_id`, awaited by `start()` on the main thread to obtain a synchronous outcome. The worker signals exactly one of four outcomes into this channel: `announce_parked` (a parkable request was captured), `announce_turn_completed_empty` (the turn finished without any approval request — analytical completion), `announce_turn_terminal_without_escalation` (the turn terminalized without a parkable capture — e.g., `kind="unknown"` parse failure), or `announce_worker_failed` (the worker raised an unhandled exception). A fifth outcome, `StartWaitElapsed`, is synthesized on the main thread if the worker has not signaled within `START_OUTCOME_WAIT_SECONDS` — this is a synchronous handshake budget, not a wedge detector (see §Capture-ready handshake). "Capture-ready" in the channel name is historical; a less-misleading rename is deferred to implementation-time refactor. See §Late start-outcome signals for the lifecycle contract that governs worker `announce_*` calls arriving after the channel has already resolved.

    #               | "aborted"  (signal_internal_abort took effect; worker waking

`ReservationToken` is an opaque handle returned by `reserve()` and consumed by exactly one subsequent `commit_signal` or `abort_reservation` call. It carries enough internal state (request_id, entry generation counter) to reject stale tokens — e.g., if the entry was discarded and re-registered between reserve and commit, the stale token's commit_signal becomes a no-op or raises. See §Transactional registry protocol for the full lifecycle.

`ParkedCaptureResult` is a sum type:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Parked:
    request_id: str

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TurnCompletedWithoutCapture:
    pass  # Codex finished its objective without requesting approval (analytical success)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class TurnTerminalWithoutEscalation:
    # Terminal non-escalation outcome. Worker has already persisted the terminal job
    # status (e.g., "unknown") and written any audit trail (e.g., the parse-failure
    # PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown") record). start() returns — does NOT raise.
    # Packet 1 emits this variant ONLY for kind="unknown" parse failures; the Literal
    # constrains the current surface but is written to accept future extensions.
    job_status: Literal["unknown"]
    reason: str                       # e.g., "unknown_kind_parse_failure"
    request_id: str | None            # persisted-for-audit request id, if any

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class WorkerFailed:
    # Genuine worker-side exception (e.g., transport failure, handler bug).
    # NOT used for unknown-kind parse failures — those use TurnTerminalWithoutEscalation.
    error: Exception

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class StartWaitElapsed:
    # Synchronous start-wait budget elapsed without a terminal outcome signal from
    # the worker. NOT a failure — the worker may still be executing a valid long
    # turn (e.g., a purely analytical delegation) and has simply not yet requested
    # approval or reached turn-completion. start() returns a plain DelegationJob
    # with status="running"; the caller polls to observe the eventual outcome.
    # Late announce_* signals from the worker for this job_id become warning/
    # no-op at the start-outcome channel layer (see §Late start-outcome signals).
    pass

ParkedCaptureResult = (
    Parked
    | TurnCompletedWithoutCapture
    | TurnTerminalWithoutEscalation
    | WorkerFailed
    | StartWaitElapsed
)
```

The registry is the sole cross-thread mutable state (IO-2). It uses a `threading.Lock` for the per-request CAS and `threading.Event`s for both the per-request wake and the per-job capture-ready signal. Entries are discarded entry-by-entry as each turn's resolution concludes; the registry itself lives for the plugin process.

**Ordering guarantees — path-specific.** Journal file-order monotonicity for the `approval_resolution` idempotency key (`intent → dispatched → completed`) is load-bearing because `journal._terminal_phases` at `journal.py:345-349` builds its terminal-phase dict from `replay_jsonl` in file order; a late-arriving `intent` after `completed` would make a resolved operation look unresolved under recovery. The mechanism that preserves this invariant is path-specific:

- **Operator decision path (decide):** main thread writes `approval_resolution.intent` **before** calling `commit_signal`. The worker, which writes `dispatched` and `completed`, cannot wake before `commit_signal` fires. Cross-thread ordering is enforced by the transactional protocol (below).
- **Timeout path:** the timer signals the worker immediately after in-memory reservation; no journal write fires on the timer's thread. The worker, on wake, writes `approval_resolution.intent` (with `decision=None`) **first**, then `dispatched`, then `completed` — all on a single thread. File-order monotonicity is trivially preserved by sequential single-writer execution.

This is a narrower rule than the previous "intent durable before signal" invariant and it is honest about the two paths' different ownership models.

### Transactional registry protocol

`decide()` must perform two durable side effects and one non-durable side effect in a specific order, with well-defined failure behavior between each step. The transactional protocol makes that structure explicit.

**States and transitions:**

```
┌─────────────┐  reserve()   ┌──────────┐  commit_signal(token)  ┌───────────┐
│  awaiting   │─────────────►│ reserved │───────────────────────►│ consuming │
│ (worker     │              │ (decide  │                        │ (worker   │
│  blocked)   │◄─────────────│  pre-    │                        │  waking)  │
│             │  abort_      │  commit) │                        │           │
└─────────────┘  reservation └──────────┘                        └───────────┘
       │          (token)
       │  signal_internal_abort(rid, reason)
       │  (atomic; see §Internal abort coordination)
       ▼
┌─────────────┐
│   aborted   │
│ (worker     │
│  waking     │
│  with       │
│  Internal-  │
│  Abort)     │
└─────────────┘
```

Two terminal transitions are **irreversible** by contract: `reserved → consuming` (operator decide path) and `awaiting → aborted` (internal abort path). `reserved → awaiting` via `abort_reservation` is the one reversible transition, and only safe *before* the caller has written any durable side effect tied to this reservation. Once an entry reaches `consuming` or `aborted`, only `discard()` (called by the worker after finalizing) removes it from the registry. Any subsequent `reserve()` against a `consuming` or `aborted` entry returns `None` — this is how late-firing timers and racing operator `decide()` calls cleanly no-op against entries that other paths have already claimed.

**decide()'s use of the protocol:**

```python
def decide(job_id, request_id, decision, answers) -> DelegationDecisionResult:
    # 1. Validate args (existing logic)
    payload = build_response_payload(decision, answers, request)

    # 2. Reserve (CAS awaiting → reserved). If None, caller already decided.
    token = registry.reserve(request_id, Resolution(payload=payload, kind=request.kind))
    if token is None:
        return _reject(reason="request_already_decided", ...)

    try:
        # 3. Write durable intent. THIS is the authority-making step — on
        # success, the operation is recoverable and MUST be committed.
        journal.write_phase(OperationJournalEntry(
            operation="approval_resolution", phase="intent",
            decision=decision, job_id=job_id, request_id=request_id, ...,
        ))
    except BaseException:
        # Intent never landed. Roll back the reservation so a retry or
        # the timer can claim the slot. Re-raise to surface the error.
        registry.abort_reservation(token)
        raise

    # 4. Commit + signal. Irreversible; worker wakes here.
    registry.commit_signal(token)

    # 5. Audit — post-commit, non-gating. Audit failure is logged as a
    # warning but does NOT roll back the signal (per IO-5, audit is not
    # durable enough to gate worker wake).
    try:
        journal.append_audit_event(AuditEvent(action=decision, ...))
    except BaseException as exc:
        logger.warning("Audit event append failed post-commit: %s", exc)

    return DelegationDecisionResult(decision_accepted=True, job_id=job_id, request_id=request_id)
```

**Failure analysis per step:**

| Failure between… | Outcome | Recovery |
|---|---|---|
| `reserve()` raises | No registry mutation; no journal writes | Caller sees the exception and can retry |
| `reserve()` returns None | Slot already reserved/consumed by another call | Existing CAS semantics; reject with `request_already_decided` |
| Journal `intent` raises | `abort_reservation(token)` restores `awaiting` before re-raise | Entry back in `awaiting`; timer or retry can claim |
| Journal `intent` succeeds, `commit_signal` raises | Impossible by construction: `commit_signal` is a local `threading.Event.set()` + state mutation. If it raises, the plugin has a deeper bug — log and crash loudly rather than abort. | Plugin-critical failure; documented in the protocol |
| `commit_signal` succeeds, audit raises | Logged warning; decide returns success | Audit gap is acceptable per IO-5 |

**Reservation token and context manager.** To make the reserve/commit-or-abort pairing enforceable by reading decide()'s code, the registry exposes a context-manager variant that auto-aborts uncommitted reservations on exit:

```python
with registry.reservation(request_id, resolution) as token:
    if token is None:
        return _reject(reason="request_already_decided", ...)
    journal.write_phase(...)
    token.commit_signal()    # explicit; otherwise the with-block aborts on exit

# If journal.write_phase raised, the with-block aborts the reservation on
# context exit; commit_signal was never called.
```

Uncommitted `ReservationToken`s auto-abort when the context manager exits; explicit `.commit_signal()` promotes the token to consumed and suppresses auto-abort.

**Why audit lives outside the transaction:** Per IO-5, `append_audit_event` is best-effort (no flush, no fsync). If audit were sequenced *before* `commit_signal`, an audit failure would force `abort_reservation` — but the intent record is already durable. Aborting would create a durable "ghost intent" (journal says operator decided; registry says entry is back in awaiting). Recovery would then see an orphan intent without a matching dispatched/completed, triggering the `recovered_unresolved` recovery path for an operation that was actually about to succeed. Moving audit post-commit eliminates this class of error. The consequence is that audit events may be lost on crash between `commit_signal` and the audit append — acceptable because recovery reconstructs the operator-decision record from the operation journal's `decision` field on the intent entry.

**Intent durability is the authority boundary.** The invariant is: *once `approval_resolution.intent` is durable, the operation is committed regardless of what happens on the plugin side afterward.* The registry reservation is a coordination primitive (keeps the worker blocked until main is ready to wake it); the journal intent is the recovery authority. Rollback across the authority boundary would violate this invariant.

### Internal abort coordination (plugin-invariant violations)

Some plugin-invariant violations are discovered by the main thread *after* the worker has already parked. Two paths surface them in Packet 1:

- `start()` receives a `Parked` signal from `wait_for_parked`, but the subsequent escalation projection cannot be constructed (e.g., the refreshed job's projection returns `None` despite `Parked` having fired — see §Capture-ready handshake `Parked` case).
- `poll()` tries to project a pending request into `PendingEscalationView` and the request's `kind` is not in `EscalatableRequestKind` (e.g., a `kind="unknown"` record from a pre-Packet-1 JSONL replay — see §Projection helper rewrites). In Packet 1 `decide()` no longer returns a projected view (see §DelegationDecisionResult — new shape), so the abort trigger surfaces only on the `poll()` path; the registry-level signal stays available for any future packet that reintroduces a projection callsite.

In both cases the main thread **cannot** call `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` directly: that helper closes the worker-owned session and writes worker-owned store records, which would violate IO-1 (session ownership) and IO-3 (single-writer-per-store). Cleanup must be worker-owned. The registry supplies a dedicated signal for this class of failure.

```python
class ResolutionRegistry:
    ...
    def signal_internal_abort(self, request_id: str, reason: str) -> bool:
        """Signal the parked worker to abort this request with the given reason.

        Atomic under the registry lock:
          awaiting               → aborted  (wakes worker with InternalAbort(reason); returns True)
          reserved | consuming   → no-op,   returns False (operator path already owns it)
          aborted                → no-op,   returns False (abort already signaled)
          missing / no entry     → no-op,   returns False (never registered, or already discarded)

        Idempotent on repeated calls for the same request_id (second call is a no-op).
        Caller writes NO journal entry — internal abort is an in-memory coordination
        signal, not a durable authority. The worker owns all durable state writes
        for the abort path.
        """
        ...
```

**New wake outcome on the per-request channel.** The return of `registry.wait(request_id)` broadens from a single `Resolution` dataclass to a sum type that already implicitly covered decide-arrived and timeout-synthesized resolutions; `InternalAbort` joins that union as a third variant.

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DecisionResolution:
    payload: dict[str, Any]                   # operator-decide payload; cancel payload on timeout
    kind: PendingRequestKind
    is_timeout: bool = False                   # True iff synthesized by the registry timer

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InternalAbort:
    reason: str                                # e.g., "parked_projection_invariant_violation",
                                               # "unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection"
                                               # Sanitized and bounded on construction (see
                                               # §Observability and Honesty Rules).

Resolution = DecisionResolution | InternalAbort
```

**Worker wake sequence on `InternalAbort(reason)`.** The worker executes the following on its own thread. Single-writer-per-store and IO-1 session ownership are preserved throughout:

```
1. journal.write_phase: approval_resolution.intent     (decision=None)  # first write
2. journal.write_phase: approval_resolution.dispatched (decision=None)
3. store.record_internal_abort(rid, reason=reason)
   # Atomic op: sets status="canceled", resolution_action=None,
   # internal_abort_reason=reason, response_payload=None,
   # response_dispatch_at=None, dispatch_result=None, resolved_at=None
4. job_store.update_parked_request(job_id, None)
5. journal.write_phase: approval_resolution.completed
       (completion_origin="worker_completed")
6. audit: action="internal_abort", reason=reason       # best-effort, IO-5
7. registry.discard(rid)
8. _mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup(...)             # worker-owned cleanup; existing
                                                         # signature at delegation_controller.py:759
                                                         # takes job_id, collaboration_id,
                                                         # runtime_id, entry — no diagnostic
                                                         # reason/cause kwargs. Durable forensic
                                                         # context already lives in the store
                                                         # record written at step 3 above
                                                         # (record_internal_abort.reason).
9. raise _WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="internal_abort")
   # Handler exits via the signal, which propagates through _run_turn and
   # run_execution_turn (neither catches it) and is caught in
   # _execute_live_turn's new except clause. See §Worker terminal-branch
   # signaling primitive.
```

No `session.respond(...)` fires: the request is being *abandoned*, not resolved by operator decision. The job terminalizes as `unknown` — the plugin cannot claim semantic application of anything, because no decision was dispatched (OB-1).

**Why no `reserve → commit_signal` flow.** The two-phase protocol exists to coordinate *operator-initiated durable writes* (`decide()` writes `approval_resolution.intent` before the reservation commits, so the journal entry is durable before the worker wakes). Internal abort has no durable intent from the main thread: the main thread writes no journal record, and the worker owns the entire abort sequence including its own `intent → dispatched → completed` triplet. Collapsing `signal_internal_abort` into a single atomic state transition is not a shortcut; the cross-thread ordering concern that motivates two-phase does not exist for this path.

**IO-invariant preservation.**
- **IO-1:** Main does not touch the worker's session. The worker executes `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` (which calls `session.close`, `runtime_registry.release`) on its own thread.
- **IO-2:** The registry state transition + `threading.Event.set()` is the sole cross-thread signal; no new in-memory shared mutable state.
- **IO-3:** All store writes on the abort path (`record_internal_abort`, `update_parked_request`, terminal `_persist_job_transition`) run on the worker thread. The main thread writes nothing.
- **IO-4:** `approval_resolution.intent` is durable before `.dispatched` and `.completed` — the worker writes the three phases sequentially on a single thread, so file-order monotonicity is trivial.
- **IO-5:** The `action="internal_abort"` audit event is appended post-durable-writes, best-effort (no fsync, no gating).
- **OB-1:** Terminal status is `unknown`. The plugin claims only "I could not dispatch a decision for this request"; it makes no claim about whether the underlying capture was valid on the App Server side.

**Failure semantics if `signal_internal_abort` races.** If the operator's `decide()` wins the CAS while the main thread is en route to calling `signal_internal_abort`, the signal is a no-op (`awaiting → aborted` transition fails because the entry is already in `reserved` or `consuming`). The operator path then executes normally. The caller that tried to abort must accept whichever path committed first: this is honest concurrency — the operator's durable decision outranks a subsequent "we think this request is invalid" observation, because the decision is already durable in the journal. Callers therefore MUST NOT assume `signal_internal_abort` always takes effect; they log the return value and react accordingly. Two callsite behaviors in Packet 1:

- **`start()` (Parked projection invariant):** raises `DelegationStartError(reason="parked_projection_invariant_violation")` regardless of the signal's return. The exception path is unconditional because the main thread has already decided it cannot construct an escalation view; whether cleanup happened via abort-win or operator-decide-win, the start caller's observation is the same failure mode.
- **`poll()` (unknown-kind in escalation projection):** returns `DelegationPollResult(pending_escalation=None, ...)` regardless of the signal's return. The null projection is the honest current observation (the projection literally could not be constructed on this thread); subsequent polls observe the settled state per §What the caller observes.

### Worker terminal-branch signaling primitive

Packet 1 introduces a private typed exception, `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason: str)`, raised by the server-request handler to terminalize a worker turn cleanly without propagating as a generic exception through the outer try/except machinery.

**Problem it solves.** The existing callback contract for `Session._run_turn` (`runtime.py:194-273`) accepts only `dict[str, Any] | None` as a handler return. Returning a dict causes `session.respond()`; returning `None` suppresses auto-response but does NOT terminate the turn — the loop continues calling `next_notification()` up to its 1200-second per-call timeout (`runtime.py:233`). Branches that need to abandon the turn after completing worker-owned cleanup (internal abort, dispatch failure, non-cancel timeout with interrupt transport failure, unknown-kind capture with interrupt transport failure) have no way to exit the loop through the return channel.

Generic exception propagation is not acceptable either: `_execute_live_turn`'s outer catches at `delegation_controller.py:724-736` and `:739-752` both call `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` and re-raise. The handler has already performed its own cleanup (and in most branches, already written the final `approval_resolution.completed` journal record) before abandoning the turn; re-cleanup is wasted work, and the re-raise would be interpreted by the worker runner as `announce_worker_failed`, masking the handler-owned terminalization.

Widening the callback return channel to carry a termination sentinel (e.g., a distinct return value class) was rejected: it would conflate "no response needed" (current `None` return) with "terminate the turn" in the same channel, inviting mis-parse by implementers. Extending the channel to a tuple `(payload, terminal: bool)` was also rejected: that changes the handler-return ABI for ALL callers of `run_execution_turn`, not just the deferred-approval callers. An exception-based primitive is narrower (private to this code path), type-checkable, and Python-idiomatic for control-flow that needs to unwind the call stack.

**Primitive.** A module-private typed exception defined in `delegation_controller.py` alongside `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class _WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(Exception):
    """Raised by the server-request handler to terminalize the worker turn.

    The handler raises this AFTER performing its branch's own cleanup:
      - writing any final approval_resolution.completed record
      - calling update_parked_request(job_id, None)
      - discarding the per-request registry entry
      - calling _mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup (closes session, marks job)
      (or the timeout-success analog: _persist_job_transition(..., "canceled"))

    Caught in _execute_live_turn before the generic `except Exception` clause;
    MUST NOT escape _execute_live_turn as a raw exception or be caught by
    the worker runner — doing so would produce `announce_worker_failed` for
    a handler-terminalized branch.
    """

    reason: str
```

**Where it is raised.** Six call sites in Packet 1, each with a distinct `reason` literal:

| Call site | `reason` | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Internal abort step 9 | `"internal_abort"` | §Internal abort coordination |
| Dispatch failure path (operator-decide `session.respond` raises), after `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` | `"dispatch_failed"` | §Dispatch failure path |
| Non-cancel timeout, interrupt-transport-failure sub-branch | `"timeout_interrupt_failed"` | §Timeout path (non-cancel-capable kind) |
| Non-cancel timeout, interrupt-succeeded sub-branch (durable cancel cleanup committed; terminalizes `DelegationJob.status="canceled"` — distinct branch from the unknown-terminalization branches) | `"timeout_interrupt_succeeded"` | §Timeout path (non-cancel-capable kind) |
| Cancel-capable timeout, `session.respond({"decision": "cancel"})` transport failure | `"timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed"` | §Timeout path (cancel-capable kind) |
| Unknown-kind capture, interrupt-transport-failure | `"unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure"` | §Unknown-kind contract |

The first five raise sites are **post-decide or post-Parked-capture**: `wait_for_parked` has already returned (for operator-decide) or the worker is on a non-operator wake path that occurs after capture (for timeouts and internal abort); the caller is observing via `poll()`. The sixth is **pre-capture**: `wait_for_parked` is still blocked; the main thread needs a precise raise.

**Operator-trigger vs. timeout-trigger dispatch-failure distinction.** `"dispatch_failed"` and `"timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed"` both arise from `session.respond(...)` transport failure, and both terminalize `DelegationJob.status="unknown"` per OB-1. They are distinct sentinel reasons because the forensic story differs: `"dispatch_failed"` implies an operator-decided resolution was lost in transport (`resolution_action="approve"|"deny"` on the request record; `record_dispatch_failure` mutator), while `"timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed"` implies a timeout-synthesized cancel was lost in transport (`resolution_action=None`, `timed_out=True`; `record_timeout` mutator with `dispatch_result="failed"`). Audit queries distinguish the two via the request-record mutator anchor, not via the sentinel reason; the sentinel reason is implementer-facing breadcrumb for control-flow diagnosis, not a durable audit field.

**Where it is caught.** In `_execute_live_turn`, at a new `except _WorkerTerminalBranchSignal` clause placed BEFORE the existing `except Exception` at `delegation_controller.py:730`:

```python
try:
    turn_result = entry.session.run_execution_turn(
        thread_id=entry.thread_id,
        prompt_text=prompt_text,
        sandbox_policy=build_workspace_write_sandbox_policy(worktree_path),
        approval_policy=self._approval_policy,
        server_request_handler=_server_request_handler,
    )
except _WorkerTerminalBranchSignal as signal:
    # Handler already performed its branch's cleanup. Do NOT call
    # _mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup here (that would double-clean),
    # and do NOT re-raise as generic Exception (that would be caught by
    # the worker runner and fire announce_worker_failed).
    if signal.reason == "unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure":
        # Pre-capture terminal transport failure. Surface to wait_for_parked
        # with the precise reason; mapping at §WorkerFailed handler preserves
        # explicit DelegationStartError reasons (see §DelegationStartError
        # reasons — reason preservation rule).
        raise DelegationStartError(
            reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure",
            cause=None,
        )
    # Post-decide / post-Parked branches: job is already in its terminal
    # state. status="unknown" for internal_abort / dispatch_failed /
    # timeout_interrupt_failed / timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed;
    # status="canceled" for timeout_interrupt_succeeded. Return the
    # stored job state; _finalize_turn is bypassed because
    # captured_request and turn_result would be stale / meaningless
    # post-terminalization.
    return self._job_store.get(job_id)
except Exception:
    self._mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup(
        job_id=job_id,
        collaboration_id=collaboration_id,
        runtime_id=runtime_id,
        entry=entry,
    )
    raise

try:
    return self._finalize_turn(...)
except Exception:
    self._mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup(...)
    raise
```

**`_finalize_turn` bypass.** The sentinel catch returns from `_execute_live_turn` WITHOUT entering the `_finalize_turn` try block at `controller:738-752`. This is correct: `_finalize_turn` derives `final_status: JobStatus` from `captured_request.kind` and `turn_result.status` (see `delegation_controller.py:1446-1480`), neither of which carries the handler's terminalization fact. Routing through `_finalize_turn` would either incorrectly re-transition the job (e.g., to `"needs_escalation"` for a request that was just canceled) or silently no-op, depending on the captured_request snapshot — both outcomes are wrong. Bypass is the clean semantic.

**Worker runner isolation.** The worker runner's outer frame catches generic `Exception` and converts it into `announce_worker_failed(job_id, exc)`. The sentinel is fully consumed inside `_execute_live_turn`; it never reaches the worker runner. Behavior by call-site class:

- **Post-decide / post-Parked branches** (`"internal_abort"`, `"dispatch_failed"`, `"timeout_interrupt_failed"`, `"timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed"`, `"timeout_interrupt_succeeded"`): `_execute_live_turn` returns a `DelegationJob` normally. The worker runner sees a normal return, not an exception, so `announce_worker_failed` does not fire. No `announce_*` signal is needed for these cases because `wait_for_parked` has already returned; `poll()` observes the job's terminal state (`"unknown"` for the first four reasons; `"canceled"` for `"timeout_interrupt_succeeded"`). See §Late start-outcome signals for the lifecycle contract on post-return worker activity.
- **Pre-capture branch** (`"unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure"`): `_execute_live_turn` re-raises as `DelegationStartError(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure", cause=None)`. The worker runner catches this as `Exception` and fires `announce_worker_failed(job_id, exc)`. The main thread's `wait_for_parked` receives `WorkerFailed(exc)` and raises `DelegationStartError`; the §WorkerFailed handler's reason-preservation rule ensures the explicit reason flows to the caller rather than being overwritten to `"worker_failed_before_capture"`.

**Why the handler — not `_execute_live_turn` — writes the terminal store/journal records.** Every sentinel raise site has already written its branch's durable records (completion journal entry, record_timeout / record_dispatch_failure / record_internal_abort, update_parked_request, registry.discard, plus the cleanup helper's `_persist_job_transition(..., "unknown")` for the unknown-terminal branches). Raising the sentinel is the LAST step, not the first. This keeps the durable-state discipline intact: the worker is the sole writer to its store records (IO-3), and the records are complete before the turn exits. The sentinel only carries control-flow, not state.

**Invariant checklist (per raise site).**

| Site | intent/dispatched/completed journal | registry.discard | update_parked_request | cleanup helper | Resulting `DelegationJob.status` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| internal_abort | written (decision=None) | yes | yes | `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` | `"unknown"` |
| dispatch_failed | written (decide() wrote intent; worker wrote dispatched; worker wrote completed) | yes | yes | `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` | `"unknown"` |
| timeout_interrupt_failed | written (decision=None) | yes | yes | `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` | `"unknown"` |
| timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed | written (decision=None) | yes | yes | `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` | `"unknown"` |
| timeout_interrupt_succeeded | written (decision=None) | yes | yes | inline cancel cleanup sequence — NOT `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup`. Inline steps: `_persist_job_transition(job_id, "canceled")`, `_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed(job_id)`, `lineage_store.update_status(collaboration_id, "completed")` (not `"unknown"` — cancel is verified, not unverified), `runtime_registry.release(runtime_id)`, `entry.session.close()`. An implementer may factor these into a `_persist_canceled_and_cleanup` helper; the spec keeps the sequence inline to make the symmetry with `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` explicit. | `"canceled"` |
| unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure | NOT written (unknown-kind path has no `approval_resolution` lifecycle; audit PSR is the artifact) | n/a (no registry entry for unknown-kind) | n/a (no parked_request_id was set) | `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` | `"unknown"` |

Any sentinel raise that does NOT match its row above is a spec violation and an implementation bug.

**Tests to add:**

- **Sentinel bypasses `_finalize_turn`:** monkeypatch `_server_request_handler` to raise `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="dispatch_failed")` after minimal setup; verify `_execute_live_turn` returns a `DelegationJob` whose `status` matches the stored state; verify `_finalize_turn` was NOT called (assert via spy/counter on the method).
- **Sentinel does not trigger `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` double-call:** instrument `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` with a call counter; raise the sentinel after the handler-side cleanup call completes; verify the counter increments exactly once (the handler's call), not twice.
- **Sentinel does not propagate to worker runner as generic Exception:** verify that raising `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal` from the handler produces NO `announce_worker_failed` signal for post-decide/post-Parked reasons (`"internal_abort"`, `"dispatch_failed"`, `"timeout_interrupt_failed"`, `"timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed"`, `"timeout_interrupt_succeeded"`); verify the sentinel IS surfaced as `DelegationStartError(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure")` for the pre-capture reason, and that the worker runner's subsequent `announce_worker_failed(job_id, exc)` carries exactly that exception.
- **Reason-preservation through WorkerFailed:** raise `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure")` from the handler; verify `start()` raises `DelegationStartError(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure", cause=None)` at the main thread — NOT the fallback `"worker_failed_before_capture"`.
- **Invariant-checklist conformance (per raise site):** for each of the six sentinel raise sites, assert the row's expected state — journal entries present/absent, `registry.discard` called or no-op, `update_parked_request` called or no-op, cleanup-helper invocation count (exactly once for the five unknown-terminalization rows and the timeout_interrupt_succeeded inline-sequence row), and the stored `DelegationJob.status` after the sentinel is caught (`"unknown"` for the first four post-decide rows plus the pre-capture row; `"canceled"` for `timeout_interrupt_succeeded`). Any mismatch is a spec violation.

### Exception classes introduced by Packet 1

Packet 1 introduces two new Python exception classes. Both are new symbols: `rg` against the repo at spec-authoring time confirms neither exists yet (unlike `CommittedStartFinalizationError` at `delegation_controller.py:192`, which is preserved unchanged).

**`DelegationStartError`** — subclass of `RuntimeError`. Raised by `start()` and by `_execute_live_turn` (via the `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal` catch's pre-capture branch) to signal a terminal failure in the delegation-start sequence.

```python
class DelegationStartError(RuntimeError):
    """Raised by start() when the delegation-start sequence cannot produce
    a successful return value. The reason literal is part of the public
    plugin contract (exhaustive list at §DelegationStartError reasons).
    """

    reason: str
    cause: Exception | None

    def __init__(
        self,
        *,
        reason: str,
        cause: Exception | None = None,
        message: str = "",
    ) -> None:
        # __str__ contract: "{reason}: {message}" when message is non-empty,
        # else "{reason}". This guarantees MCP text-prefix recoverability
        # without requiring a boundary change (see below).
        if message:
            super().__init__(f"{reason}: {message}")
        else:
            super().__init__(reason)
        self.reason = reason
        self.cause = cause
```

Raise idiom for cases with a chained cause: `raise DelegationStartError(reason=..., cause=exc) from exc` so Python's `__cause__` chain is preserved alongside the explicit `.cause` field. The duplication (`.cause` and `__cause__`) is intentional: `__cause__` participates in tracebacks; `.cause` is the typed attribute callers can read without walking `__cause__`.

**`UnknownKindInEscalationProjection`** — subclass of `Exception` (NOT `RuntimeError`, to keep it distinct from the `start()` boundary surface). Raised by `_project_request_to_view` when `request.kind` is not in `_ESCALATABLE_REQUEST_KINDS`. Internal assertion signal; MUST NOT escape the controller boundary. Caught at each projection callsite, which owns its own abort-signaling and reason. Carries a message string only — no `reason` field, because the callsite determines the reason (see §Projection helper rewrites).

**MCP error serialization — text-prefix recoverability, not structured propagation.** The MCP boundary at `mcp_server.py:340-349` currently serializes exceptions as `{"isError": true, "content": [{"text": str(exc)}]}` with no structured reason field. Packet 1 does NOT change this boundary. The `DelegationStartError.__str__` contract above guarantees that the reason literal is the leading token of the serialized text (followed by `": "` and an optional message). MCP clients that need to branch on reason can extract it by parsing the text prefix up to the first `": "`.

This is explicitly **text-prefix recoverability**, not structured propagation:

- **What it IS:** an in-process contract (Python `isinstance` + `.reason` works) plus a stable serialization prefix that parses deterministically.
- **What it is NOT:** a structured `reason` field on the MCP wire. MCP clients do not receive a typed reason — they receive a single text string whose prefix happens to be the reason.
- **Why this is sufficient for Packet 1:** the primary consumer of `reason` is in-process (tests, other plugin code) where the typed attribute is available. An MCP-boundary change is deferred to a future packet that needs structured reasons observable to external MCP clients. The text-prefix contract is explicit so that future packet can be a pure additive extension rather than a breaking reformat.

**Test obligations:**

- `DelegationStartError(reason="foo")` produces `str(exc) == "foo"`.
- `DelegationStartError(reason="foo", message="bar")` produces `str(exc) == "foo: bar"`.
- `raise DelegationStartError(reason="foo", cause=original) from original` sets both `.cause` and `__cause__` to `original`.
- `isinstance(DelegationStartError(reason="foo"), RuntimeError)` is `True`.
- `isinstance(UnknownKindInEscalationProjection("msg"), RuntimeError)` is `False` (ensures it is caught by the narrower `except UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` clause before a generic `except RuntimeError`).

### DelegationStartError reasons

Exhaustive enumeration of `reason` literals. Any reason not in this table is a spec violation; adding a new reason in a future packet requires updating this section and the corresponding raise-site reference.

| Reason | Raise site | Semantics | Capture state at raise |
|---|---|---|---|
| `"worker_failed_before_capture"` | §WorkerFailed match handler (fallback) | Worker raised an unhandled exception before capturing any request. The `WorkerFailed` envelope's `exc` is NOT a `DelegationStartError` — the reason-preservation rule did not apply, so the fallback is used. | No `PendingServerRequest` persisted; no registry entry; `announce_worker_failed` was the signal. |
| `"parked_projection_invariant_violation"` | `start()` escalation-return branch, covering both sub-cases (null return from `_project_pending_escalation` AND raised `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection`). Collapsing both sub-cases to one broad reason is intentional — the caller's semantic is "Parked fired but no view can be built," regardless of proximate cause. | Capture succeeded (Parked fired; per-request registry entry established; `parked_request_id` persisted) but projection disagreed with that state. Worker owns async cleanup via `signal_internal_abort` with the same reason — the main-thread raise and the worker abort-path signal share the reason literal verbatim. | `PendingServerRequest` persisted; registry entry live (will be `aborted` after CAS). |
| `"unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure"` | `_execute_live_turn` sentinel catch, pre-capture branch (see §Worker terminal-branch signaling primitive). | Unknown-kind capture's `session.interrupt_turn(...)` raised a transport exception. The `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` audit record was persisted at step 1 (before the interrupt attempt at step 2), so capture DID happen even though the full unknown-kind sequence aborted. Using `"worker_failed_before_capture"` here would misclassify the verified partial capture. | Partial capture: `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` persisted as audit artifact; no registry entry (unknown-kind path does not register); `announce_worker_failed` will fire from the worker runner after the sentinel is re-raised as this `DelegationStartError`. |

**Reason-preservation rule (normative).** The §WorkerFailed match handler at `start()`'s main thread receives a `WorkerFailed(exc)` envelope from `wait_for_parked`. The rule:

```python
# At the §WorkerFailed match handler:
def on_worker_failed(envelope: WorkerFailed) -> "NoReturn":
    exc = envelope.exc
    if isinstance(exc, DelegationStartError) and exc.reason:
        # The worker already classified the failure with a precise reason.
        # Preserve it verbatim rather than collapsing to "worker_failed_before_capture".
        raise DelegationStartError(reason=exc.reason, cause=exc.__cause__ or exc)
    # Fallback: genuinely opaque worker exception with no precise reason.
    raise DelegationStartError(reason="worker_failed_before_capture", cause=exc)
```

The rule is two-directional:

1. **Post-mortem discrimination is by reason literal, not by envelope type.** `WorkerFailed` is not itself a reason; it is the transport envelope. Callers that branch on failure classification branch on `DelegationStartError.reason`, not on whether the failure came from `WorkerFailed` vs. `wait_for_parked`'s direct raise path.
2. **`"worker_failed_before_capture"` is the narrow default, not the general case.** It specifically means "we could not diagnose the failure further." Any reason ending in `_failure` or `_violation`, or carrying a precise sub-case name, indicates a worker path that classified itself before raising.

**What this means for the three existing reasons:**

- `"worker_failed_before_capture"` — used ONLY as fallback when the worker's exception is not a classified `DelegationStartError`.
- `"parked_projection_invariant_violation"` — NOT raised from the worker; raised on the main thread from `start()`'s escalation-return branch. Does not flow through `WorkerFailed`.
- `"unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure"` — raised from `_execute_live_turn`'s sentinel catch (pre-capture branch) as `DelegationStartError`. Flows through the worker runner's generic `except Exception` → `announce_worker_failed(job_id, exc)` → `WorkerFailed(exc)` envelope → the handler's rule above preserves the reason.

**Test obligations:** enumerated in the `DelegationStartError` test section above and in §Worker terminal-branch signaling primitive's reason-preservation test.

### Capture-ready handshake (start() control flow)

`start()` is synchronous at the MCP boundary — the caller expects either an escalation payload (most common), a terminal result (rare: turn finished without any approval request), or an error. The worker is the only thread with the transport; the main thread cannot observe "a request is parked" from any durable surface until the worker has written it. The handshake primitive is the per-job capture-ready channel on the registry.

**Constant:** `START_OUTCOME_WAIT_SECONDS = 30` (configurable). This is a **synchronous start-wait budget**, NOT a wedge detector. If the worker does not signal within this budget, `start()` returns a plain `DelegationJob(status="running")` so the caller can poll for the eventual outcome; it does NOT raise and does NOT assume the worker is wedged. A 45-second analytical delegation with no approval request is a legitimate use case: the worker is doing valid work and will eventually signal `announce_turn_completed_empty` once the turn finishes, but that signal arrives after the synchronous handshake has already returned. Genuine worker wedges still surface — they surface through the normal polling path (`poll()` reports `status="running"` indefinitely) and through cold-start recovery (running jobs get demoted to `unknown` on next session init). This is a different timer than `APPROVAL_OPERATOR_WINDOW_SECONDS`; the former bounds "how long start() blocks synchronously"; the latter bounds "how long an operator has to decide."

**Worker sequence (inside `_execute_live_turn` handler, on first *parkable* captured request — kind ∈ `{command_approval, file_change, request_user_input}`):**

```
1. pending_request_store.create(request)              # durable request record
2. job_store.update_parked_request(job_id, rid)       # durable selector
3. job_store._persist_job_transition(needs_escalation) # status transition
4. registry.register(rid, job_id, APPROVAL_OPERATOR_WINDOW_SECONDS)   # per-request entry: awaiting
5. registry.announce_parked(job_id, rid)              # signals main thread
6. resolution = registry.wait(rid)                    # blocks until decide() or timer
```

**Ordering rationale.** Steps 1–3 are durable-first: by the time step 5 fires, any `poll(job_id)` the caller issues returns the parked escalation consistently. Step 4 **must** precede step 5 because the handshake signal can wake the main thread arbitrarily fast; if the main thread observes `Parked` and immediately calls `decide()`, `reserve(rid)` must find the per-request entry already in `awaiting`. A reversed order (`announce_parked` before `register`) creates a race where `decide()` arrives before the worker has established the entry the reservation looks up.

**Worker sequence on captured request with `kind="unknown"` (parse failure — non-parkable):**

```
1. pending_request_store.create(PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown", ...))
                                                      # audit record (existing at delegation_controller.py:671-688)
2. session.interrupt_turn(thread_id, turn_id)         # existing at :690-695
3. [turn loop exits after interrupt]
4. post-turn cleanup routes interrupted_by_unknown → final_status="unknown"
                                                      # see §Unknown-kind contract callsite changes at controller:1473, :1482-1510
5. job_store._persist_job_transition("unknown")       # terminal status
6. registry.announce_turn_terminal_without_escalation(
       job_id,
       status="unknown",
       reason="unknown_kind_parse_failure",
       request_id=<persisted_request_id>,
   )                                                   # signals main thread
7. worker thread exits
```

**`interrupt_turn` failure in the unknown-kind path (caller observation + forensic-field asymmetry with non-cancel timeout).** If `session.interrupt_turn` at step 2 raises a transport exception, the handler catches it, calls `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup(...)` (which sets `DelegationJob.status="unknown"` and closes the session/runtime), and raises `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure")`. The sentinel is caught in `_execute_live_turn`'s new catch clause (see §Worker terminal-branch signaling primitive) which recognizes the pre-capture reason and re-raises as `DelegationStartError(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure", cause=None)`. That propagates to the worker runner, fires `announce_worker_failed(job_id, exc)`, and surfaces through `wait_for_parked` → `WorkerFailed(exc)` → `DelegationStartError` with the reason preserved (see §DelegationStartError reasons — reason-preservation rule). The caller's `start()` raises with the precise reason; `"worker_failed_before_capture"` is NOT used here because capture DID happen (the `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` audit record was persisted at step 1 before step 2 fired), so the pre-capture-exception reason-name would be misclassifying the failure. No `announce_turn_terminal_without_escalation` fires (that signal requires the full unknown-kind sequence through step 6 to have completed, which the interrupt failure aborted).

No `interrupt_error` field is written in this path, because the unknown-kind capture sequence has no atomic `record_timeout`-class write to attach the forensic annotation to (the `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` record is the audit artifact itself, and mutating it for post-interrupt forensics would conflate capture-time metadata with post-turn cleanup). The non-cancel timeout path differs: it has a durable `record_timeout` write that is the natural forensic landing spot for transport-failure annotations, which is why `interrupt_error` is specified only there. The sanitized exception string on the unknown-kind path is carried on the `DelegationStartError.cause`-adjacent logging surface (structured log line at raise time, matching the same sanitization rules as `interrupt_error`); durable per-request forensic annotation for this sub-case is an explicit non-goal for Packet 1. An implementer considering a symmetric `interrupt_error` on the unknown-kind path should route that signal through an outcome/audit event instead, not through `PendingServerRequest` mutation.

**Why no registry entry for `kind="unknown"`.** No `register`, no `wait`. There is no entry to wake, no timer to start, and no way for `decide()` to target this request successfully. `decide()` on the persisted audit-trail request returns `RequestDecisionRejected(job_not_awaiting_decision)` (the job is terminal, not awaiting). See §Unknown-kind contract for the full rationale and the current-vs-Packet-1 behavior comparison.

**Worker sequence on turn-completion-without-capture (Codex finished its objective without needing approval):**

```
1. turn loop exits normally (turn/completed observed with no prior handler parking)
2. _finalize_turn builds the normal (non-escalation) outcome
3. registry.announce_turn_completed_empty(job_id)     # signals main
4. worker thread exits
```

**Worker sequence on exception during pre-capture or capture itself:**

```
1. exception propagates out of handler or turn loop
2. existing _mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup runs (delegation_controller.py:759)
3. registry.announce_worker_failed(job_id, exc)       # signals main
4. worker thread exits
```

**Main-thread (`start()`) sequence:**

`start()` keeps its existing external return union — `DelegationJob | DelegationEscalation | JobBusyResponse` — and does NOT introduce a new wrapper. The five internal registry outcomes map onto this union (or into exceptions for the two error outcomes):

```python
def start(args) -> DelegationJob | DelegationEscalation | JobBusyResponse:
    # Busy gate, job creation, journal writes, and worker spawn are unchanged
    # from current delegation_controller.py:267-700. Only the wait/match is new.

**Status transitions visible to `start()`:**

| Worker outcome | `job.status` when `start()` returns | Returned to MCP caller |
|---|---|---|
| Parked | `needs_escalation` | `DelegationEscalation(job, pending_escalation, agent_context)` — existing shape, unchanged. Sub-case: if the refreshed-job projection returns `None` OR raises `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` (plugin-invariant violation — from `start()`'s perspective both map to the same semantic: Parked fired but no view can be built, regardless of proximate cause: missing request, resolved tombstone, unexpected kind, or future callsite), `start()` signals `registry.signal_internal_abort(rid, "parked_projection_invariant_violation")` and raises `DelegationStartError(reason="parked_projection_invariant_violation")`. Worker owns cleanup (see §Internal abort coordination). |
| TurnCompletedWithoutCapture | Terminal (`completed` via `_finalize_turn`) | plain `DelegationJob(status="completed", ...)` |
| TurnTerminalWithoutEscalation | Terminal (`unknown` — persisted by worker before signal) | plain `DelegationJob(status="unknown", ...)` — **returns, does not raise**. Causal record lives on the persisted `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` audit entry at `:671-688`; `DelegationOutcomeRecord` remains the ordinary terminal analytics record (no `reason`/`request_id` fields; not extended by Packet 1). |
| WorkerFailed | `unknown` (via `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup`) | raises `DelegationStartError(reason="worker_failed_before_capture")` |
| StartWaitElapsed | `running` (unchanged by main thread) | plain `DelegationJob(status="running", ...)` — **returns, does not raise**. Caller polls for outcome. One-line log warning records the budget-elapsed event. |

**Why `TurnTerminalWithoutEscalation` is distinct from `WorkerFailed`:** both can produce `job.status="unknown"`, but they differ in **who failed**. `WorkerFailed` signals that the worker itself raised an unhandled exception (transport failure, handler bug) — the operator-visible outcome is an error (`DelegationStartError` raised). `TurnTerminalWithoutEscalation` signals that the worker handled unparseable input *correctly* and terminalized the job — the operator-visible outcome is a normal return (a plain `DelegationJob` with `status="unknown"`). Conflating the two would force callers to distinguish "the plugin broke" from "the request couldn't be rendered" by inspecting exception payloads rather than by return-vs-raise polarity.

**Why `parked_projection_invariant_violation` is distinct from `worker_failed_before_capture`:** both are `DelegationStartError` subtypes and both terminalize the job as `unknown` via `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` on the worker thread. They differ in **what the worker observed**. `worker_failed_before_capture` means the worker raised an unhandled exception before capturing any request (no persisted `PendingServerRequest`, no registry entry, `announce_worker_failed` signal). `parked_projection_invariant_violation` means capture SUCCEEDED (`Parked` fired, per-request registry entry established, `parked_request_id` persisted) but a subsequent plugin-side projection disagreed with that state — the signal and the materialized view are out of sync. The reason name preserves the post-mortem distinction: the former indicates a worker crash; the latter indicates a consistency bug between Parked-signaling and projection.

**`worker_failed_before_capture` is not the exclusive `WorkerFailed` reason.** The §WorkerFailed match handler applies the reason-preservation rule: if the worker raised an explicit `DelegationStartError` (e.g., `"unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure"` from `_execute_live_turn`'s sentinel-catch), the reason flows through intact. `"worker_failed_before_capture"` is the fallback name for genuinely opaque worker exceptions without a pre-diagnosed reason. This means post-mortem discrimination is by reason literal, not by the `WorkerFailed` envelope: any reason ending in `_failure`, `_violation`, or carrying a precise sub-case name came from a worker path that classified itself before raising; `worker_failed_before_capture` specifically means "we could not diagnose the failure further." An unknown-kind path that partially completes (audit record persisted at step 1) and then fails `session.interrupt_turn` at step 2 is one such classified sub-case — the reason name `"unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure"` is accurate (capture DID happen at step 1, only the transport-interrupt failed), so forcing `"worker_failed_before_capture"` would misclassify a verified-partial-capture as an unclassified crash.

**Why `StartWaitElapsed` does not force-kill the worker or raise:** Python threads cannot be safely cancelled from outside. Forcing a kill would orphan transport state, leak stdin/stdout handles, and leave stores mid-write. Raising a `DelegationStartError` would be a second category error: we do not actually know that anything went wrong — the worker may be processing a valid long turn. The safe path is: return `DelegationJob(status="running")`, leave the job in `running`, and let the caller's normal polling path observe the eventual outcome. Genuinely-wedged workers — the subset of `StartWaitElapsed` cases where the worker never terminalizes — surface through two existing mechanisms: (a) the caller's polling continues to show `status="running"` indefinitely, which is the honest observation; (b) cold-start recovery at `delegation_controller.py:2036-2038` demotes any `running` job on next session init. Explicit mid-session wedge detection (kill orphans by threshold) is follow-up surface area for a future packet, not Packet 1.

**Why `TurnCompletedWithoutCapture` is a legitimate outcome:** Codex may complete an objective in a single turn without triggering any server-request approval (no shell command, no file change, no user input) — for example, a purely analytical delegation. The worker's normal `_finalize_turn` path writes the terminal outcome; the handshake signals that main can return the non-escalation result.

### Late start-outcome signals (post-`wait_for_parked` lifecycle)

Under `StartWaitElapsed`, `start()` returns while the worker is still running. The worker will eventually reach one of its normal signal points — `announce_parked`, `announce_turn_completed_empty`, `announce_turn_terminal_without_escalation`, or `announce_worker_failed` — but by then the main thread is no longer waiting on the per-job start-outcome channel. This is the late-signal case; Packet 1 defines its semantics precisely.

**Lifecycle rule:** `wait_for_parked` discards the per-job `CaptureReadyEvent` upon returning ANY outcome, including the synthesized `StartWaitElapsed`. Worker `announce_*` calls for the same `job_id` after the event is discarded observe an empty channel and behave as follows:

1. **Wake effect:** no-op. There is no main thread blocked on the channel, so there is no one to wake. The registry logs a one-line warning at INFO/DEBUG level (`"late start-outcome signal ignored"`) with the `job_id` and the signal kind.
2. **Durable state:** **untouched**. The worker's durable writes that PRECEDE every `announce_*` call have already landed and stand authoritative:
   - `announce_parked` is preceded by `pending_request_store.create(...)`, `job_store.update_parked_request(...)`, `job_store._persist_job_transition("needs_escalation")`, and `registry.register(rid, ...)` — so `poll()` subsequently observes the escalation and `decide(rid)` can find and reserve the per-request entry.
   - `announce_turn_completed_empty` is preceded by `_finalize_turn`'s terminal-state write — so `poll()` subsequently observes `status="completed"`.
   - `announce_turn_terminal_without_escalation` is preceded by `job_store._persist_job_transition("unknown")` and the persisted `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` audit record — so `poll()` subsequently observes `status="unknown"`.
   - `announce_worker_failed` is preceded by `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` — so `poll()` subsequently observes `status="unknown"`.
3. **Per-request registry entry:** **authoritative**. Critically, the per-request `RegistryEntry` keyed by `request_id` is a SEPARATE data structure from the per-job `CaptureReadyEvent`. Late `announce_parked` losing its wake effect does NOT remove or disable the per-request entry created by `register(rid)`. A subsequent `decide(rid)` from the main thread still finds the entry in `"awaiting"`, reserves it, commits, and wakes the (still-blocking) worker via `registry.wait(rid)`. The registry's two channels have independent lifecycles.

**Implications for caller observability:**

- After `start() → DelegationJob(status="running")`, the caller polls. The next poll may see: still `running` (worker hasn't signaled yet), `needs_escalation` (late `announce_parked` case — worker parked and is blocking on `registry.wait`), `completed` (late `announce_turn_completed_empty`), or `unknown` (late `announce_turn_terminal_without_escalation` or late `announce_worker_failed`). All four are valid poll observations.
- The caller does NOT need a new MCP tool or error-recovery path. The existing `poll()` surface is sufficient; `decide()` continues to work on parked requests whose escalation was surfaced via poll rather than via start.

**`agent_context` availability (Packet 1 semantics).** Neither `start()`'s deferred-escalation return nor any `poll()` observation carries an `agent_context` string in Packet 1. The existing `DelegationEscalation.agent_context` field (`models.py:415`) stays in place but is `None` for every deferred-capture path, and `DelegationPollResult` (`models.py:470-476`) continues to have no `agent_context` field at all — its shape is preserved unchanged.

Rationale: the existing `agent_context` data source is `turn_result.agent_message` (populated during `_run_turn` on `item/completed` notifications at `runtime.py:249-254`, surfaced at `delegation_controller.py:1504-1512` in the post-finalize path). In the deferred model, the worker is still inside `_run_turn` — blocking on `registry.wait(rid)` from within the server-request handler — when `announce_parked` fires. The turn has not finalized; `turn_result.agent_message` does not yet exist. Any "build agent_context from the parked job" helper would have to materialize a string from data that has not been captured. There is no such helper in the code today, and Packet 1 intentionally does not add one.

Callers that relied on the existing `agent_context` for synchronous-escalation prompt rendering should fall back to the fields already carried on `PendingEscalationView.requested_scope` (kind-specific metadata; see `models.py:441-452`). A future packet may introduce a `latest_agent_message: str | None` field on `PendingServerRequest` written by the worker as each `item/completed` notification arrives, projected into `agent_context` on both `DelegationEscalation` and a new `DelegationPollResult.agent_context` field. That work is deferred: Packet 1's scope is already large, and the synchronous-path regression (if any) is bounded to prompt UX, not correctness.

**Atomicity note:** the discard of the `CaptureReadyEvent` must be race-free with the worker's signal. Implementation uses `dict.pop(job_id, None)` under the registry lock: either the signal wins (main consumes the outcome; worker's signal was observed) or the main-thread timer wins (main synthesizes `StartWaitElapsed`; worker's subsequent signal finds the channel gone). In no case can both paths resolve with conflicting outcomes.

**Tests to add:**

- Late-park observation: force `START_OUTCOME_WAIT_SECONDS` to elapse before the worker signals; verify `start()` returns `DelegationJob(status="running")`; verify subsequent `poll()` returns the escalation; verify `decide()` then completes the flow end-to-end.
- Late terminal-signal no-crash: force `START_OUTCOME_WAIT_SECONDS` to elapse; worker then calls `announce_turn_completed_empty` for the same `job_id`; verify no exception raises on the worker thread and the warning is logged; verify subsequent `poll()` returns `status="completed"`.
- Late worker-failed no-crash: same shape but worker signals `announce_worker_failed`; verify no exception raises; subsequent `poll()` returns `status="unknown"`.
- Concurrent signal-vs-timeout race: induce the worker to call `announce_parked` at the exact moment the main thread's timer fires; verify exactly one path resolves (either Parked escalation or StartWaitElapsed running-return), never both.

```

**Ordering invariants visible in the diagram:**

1. **Capture-ready before escalation return.** `start()` does not return an escalation until the worker's `announce_parked` signal arrives. All durable state (`pending_request_store.create`, `job_store.update_parked_request`, `job.status = needs_escalation`) is written before the signal, so `start()`'s re-read sees a consistent snapshot.
2. **Per-request entry registered before capture-ready signal.** The worker calls `registry.register(rid)` before `registry.announce_parked(job_id, rid)`. A pathologically fast `decide()` from the main thread (observing `Parked` and immediately calling `decide()`) can never reach `reserve(rid)` before the per-request entry exists.
3. **Journal `intent` durable before registry `commit_signal`.** `decide()` writes `approval_resolution.intent` to the operation journal (fsynced per IO-4) before calling `registry.commit_signal(token)`. The worker, which writes `dispatched` and `completed`, cannot wake before `commit_signal` fires — preserving file-order monotonicity of the `approval_resolution` idempotency key.
4. **Audit append is post-commit.** `journal.append_audit_event` fires after `commit_signal` returns and after decide() has already constructed its return value. Audit failure is a logged warning (IO-5: audit is not fsynced and cannot gate worker wake); it never rolls back the commit. This placement eliminates the "ghost intent" failure mode that would arise if audit sat inside the pre-signal critical section (see §Transactional registry protocol).

**`session.respond(rid, payload)` may raise.** The happy-path diagram above shows the success branch only. If `respond()` raises (e.g., `BrokenPipeError` wrapped into `RuntimeError` at `jsonrpc_client.py:123-130`), the worker follows the **Dispatch failure path** — see the dedicated subsection below — which atomically records `dispatch_result="failed"`, marks the request `canceled`, writes `approval_resolution.completed`, and terminalizes the job as `unknown` (not `failed`, per OB-1).

### Timeout path (non-cancel-capable kind: request_user_input)

  if token is None: return                    # stale timer: no store, journal, audit, wake, or session side effect
  commit_signal(token)                        # reserved → consuming + signal ─► wake

      # Interrupt-succeeded sub-branch. Durable cancel cleanup above has
      # committed (record_timeout, update_parked_request, journal.completed,
      # audit, registry.discard). Now perform the terminal worker-thread
      # cleanup inline, then raise _WorkerTerminalBranchSignal to bypass
      # _finalize_turn. See §Worker terminal-branch signaling primitive
      # invariant checklist for the exact sequence and its rationale.
      #
      # Rationale for NOT using "handler returns None" here: if the handler
      # returns None, _run_turn at runtime.py:232-273 continues to its
      # natural exit on turn/completed (with status="interrupted") and
      # returns a TurnExecutionResult. _execute_live_turn then invokes
      # _finalize_turn at delegation_controller.py:739-749, whose status
      # derivation at :1473-1478 reclassifies (captured_request.kind=
      # "request_user_input" + turn_result.status="interrupted") to
      # needs_escalation — silently overwriting the "canceled" write below.
      # The sentinel-raise path bypasses _finalize_turn cleanly.
      #
      # Note on the App Server's pending turn/completed: the subprocess
      # will still emit turn/completed (status="interrupted") after
      # entry.session.close() below. It is not observed because the
      # session's notification loop is torn down. This is consistent
      # with the other post-decide sentinel branches (internal_abort,
      # dispatch_failed, timeout_interrupt_failed, timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed),
      # all of which tear down the session before the App Server's
      # completion notification can be observed.

      _emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed(job_id)
      lineage_store.update_status(collaboration_id, "completed")
      # Note: lineage gets "completed", NOT "unknown", because the cancel
      # is verified (App Server acknowledged the interrupt). The
      # unknown-terminalization branches use "unknown" for both the
      # DelegationJob and the lineage record; the cancel-verified branch

      # OB-1 applies: "we cannot verify the subprocess honored our cancel"
      # collapses to DelegationJob.status="unknown" (same honest semantics
      # as §Dispatch failure path). record_timeout above preserved the
      # forensic detail (timed_out=True + interrupt_error=<sanitized>) on
      # the PendingServerRequest; job-level observation is "unknown".
      _mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup(...)
      # Existing signature (delegation_controller.py:759); sets
      # DelegationJob.status="unknown" via _persist_job_transition and

      raise _WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="timeout_interrupt_failed")
      # Caught in _execute_live_turn per §Worker terminal-branch signaling
      # primitive; _finalize_turn is bypassed; caller observes
      # DelegationJob.status="unknown" via the stored job record.
```

**DelegationJob.status outcomes across this path** (the two sub-branches settle on different job-level terminal states even though the `PendingServerRequest` record is the same atomic `record_timeout` write in both):

| Sub-branch | `PendingServerRequest.status` | `PendingServerRequest.timed_out` | `PendingServerRequest.interrupt_error` | `DelegationJob.status` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Interrupt succeeded | `"canceled"` | `True` | `None` | `"canceled"` |
| Interrupt transport-failed | `"canceled"` | `True` | sanitized error string | `"unknown"` |

**Why the split job-status outcome is correct (OB-1 applied):** when `interrupt_turn` succeeded, the plugin has a verifiable cancel (App Server's subsequent `turn/completed` with `status="interrupted"` closes the loop). When it failed transport-side, the plugin cannot verify whether the subprocess honored the cancel. Same rationale as §Dispatch failure path: verified cancel → `canceled`; unverifiable → `unknown`. Callers that need to distinguish "the plugin gave up" (`canceled`) from "the plugin cannot verify" (`unknown`) have the job-level signal; callers that only care about request-level outcome see `canceled` in both sub-branches via the `PendingServerRequest` record.

**Why `record_timeout` instead of `record_response_dispatch` + `update_status`.** The `record_response_dispatch(action=Literal["approve", "deny"], ...)` signature cannot represent a timeout — there is no operator `action`, and writing `resolution_action` to any non-None value would conflate operator-fact with circumstance-fact (Q7 invariant from the brainstorm). `record_timeout` is a dedicated mutator that **atomically** sets `timed_out=True`, `status="canceled"`, and the optional dispatch fields (None-tuple for the interrupt path; populated for the cancel-dispatch path). A separate `update_status` call would split the timed_out/status transition across two journal records, introducing a replay window where `timed_out=True` and `status="pending"` could be briefly observed — inconsistent with the atomicity the mutator contract guarantees.

**Timer ownership note (Packet 1 model).** The registry's internal timeout timer is a `threading.Timer` owned by each `RegistryEntry`. It performs ONLY in-memory state changes and the wake signal: `token = reserve(rid, timeout_resolution); if token is None: return; commit_signal(token)`. The `None` early-return is the stale-timer path documented below. It does not write to the operation journal, the pending request store, the delegation job store, or the audit log. This keeps the registry a pure coordination primitive (IO-2) and avoids introducing a third journal writer beyond main and worker. All durable effects for a timeout — `approval_resolution.intent`, `dispatched`, `completed`, `record_timeout`, `update_parked_request`, audit — happen on the worker thread after wake, in single-writer sequence. File-order monotonicity of the `approval_resolution` idempotency key is therefore preserved trivially, without cross-thread coordination.

**Stale timer contract.** The timer callback calls `reserve(rid, timeout_resolution)` and returns immediately if it receives `None`; for entries already in `aborted`, `consuming`, or `discarded`, the timer performs no store, journal, audit, registry wake, or session side effect. This is the mechanism that prevents a late-firing timer from racing with a concluding abort or decide path — the existing CAS-reject rule in `reserve()` is the sole coordination primitive, and no explicit timer-cancellation is required on `signal_internal_abort` or `commit_signal`. The harmless wake is the cost of reusing one coordination primitive for three races (decide-vs-timer, abort-vs-timer, abort-vs-decide).

**Why cross-thread "intent durable before signal" does not apply here.** In the decide path, main writes `intent` and worker writes `dispatched/completed` — two threads must coordinate so `intent` lands first. In the timeout path, the timer writes nothing to the journal; the worker writes the entire `intent → dispatched → completed` sequence on a single thread. There is no cross-thread race to protect. The narrower invariant ("intent durable before the next-phase record for the same idempotency key") is preserved by local sequencing. The `decision=None` on timeout intent/dispatched records is the human-readable discriminator for "this record came from a timer, not an operator decide" — combined with the `PendingServerRequest.timed_out=True` marker and the `action="approval_timeout"` audit event (best-effort, IO-5).

**Intent durability under failure (timeout path).** Parallel to the dispatch-failure statement in §Dispatch failure path: the worker writes `approval_resolution.intent` (decision=None) first, then `dispatched`, then `record_timeout`. If the worker crashes after `dispatched` but before `record_timeout` lands, cold-start recovery writes `completed` with `completion_origin="recovered_unresolved"` and demotes the job — and the `timed_out=True` marker plus any `interrupt_error` captured in the worker-thread's try/except are both lost. That loss is acceptable only because it is a strict subset of the "process crashed" recovery boundary already documented in §Recovery: the plugin cannot distinguish "worker crashed during `session.interrupt_turn`" from "worker crashed during `record_timeout`" after the fact, and both collapse to the same caller-visible outcome (`job.status="unknown"` via recovery). If a future packet needs tighter forensic guarantees for the timeout path, the fix is to move `record_timeout` before `session.interrupt_turn` (writing `timed_out=True`/`status="canceled"` first, then the best-effort interrupt, then a separate `record_interrupt_error` mutator) — explicitly out of Packet 1 scope because the current symmetric-loss behavior matches the dispatch-failure path's already-documented and accepted semantics.

### Dispatch failure path (`session.respond()` raises)

This is the failure mode where the operator's decision was accepted and the reservation was committed, but the worker's subsequent `session.respond(...)` call raises — most commonly `BrokenPipeError` from a Codex subprocess that died mid-turn (wrapped into `RuntimeError` at `jsonrpc_client.py:123-130`). Packet 1 makes this path auditable rather than invisible.

```
WORKER on wake (after decide() committed reservation; main already returned DecisionAccepted):
  [approval_resolution.intent is already durable — decide() wrote it pre-commit]
  job_store._persist_job_transition(running)
  journal.write_phase: approval_resolution.dispatched
  try:
      session.respond(rid, payload)                  # may raise RuntimeError on broken pipe
  except Exception as exc:
      # Transport-level failure. Atomically capture the forensic fact +
      # non-actionable status in one store write (see mutator rationale below).
      store.record_dispatch_failure(
          rid,
          action=resolution_action,                  # "approve" | "deny"
          payload=payload,
          dispatch_at=<iso_timestamp>,
          dispatch_error=<serialized_exc>,
      )
      # Atomic op: sets resolution_action, response_payload,
      # response_dispatch_at, dispatch_result="failed", status="canceled",
      # resolved_at=None  (resolved_at stays None — dispatch did not resolve).
      job_store.update_parked_request(job_id, None)
      journal.write_phase: approval_resolution.completed
          (completion_origin="worker_completed")
      # Audit is best-effort (IO-5); logged as warning if it fails.
      audit: action="dispatch_failed", dispatch_result="failed"
      registry.discard(rid)
      # Terminalize the job. Status is "unknown", NOT "failed" — transport
      # failure means we cannot verify whether App Server applied the operator
      # decision (OB-1). The honest terminal status is "unknown".
      _mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup(...)
      # Existing signature (delegation_controller.py:759); no diagnostic
      # reason/cause kwargs. The failure reason is durable on the request
      # record via record_dispatch_failure.dispatch_error above.
      raise _WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="dispatch_failed")
      # Handler exits via the signal, which is caught in _execute_live_turn
      # (see §Worker terminal-branch signaling primitive). The original
      # transport exception has been captured durably on the request record;
      # it is NOT re-raised. _finalize_turn is bypassed; caller observes
      # DelegationJob.status="unknown" via the stored job record on poll().
  # Success path continues in the happy-path diagram.
  store.record_response_dispatch(rid, ...)   # dispatch_result hardcoded to
                                             # "succeeded" inside the mutator
  store.mark_resolved(rid, resolved_at)
  ...
```

**Why a dedicated atomic mutator (`record_dispatch_failure`) instead of a hypothetical `record_response_dispatch` that also accepted `dispatch_result="failed"` + separate `update_status`.** Same atomicity argument as `record_timeout` in §Timeout path. Splitting the forensic write and the status transition across two store records opens a replay window where `dispatch_result="failed"` + `status="pending"` could be briefly observed — an inconsistent pair that no point in the lifecycle should ever show. A dedicated mutator writes both fields in one append, preserving single-record atomicity under crash-mid-write. The permissive signature is additionally unrepresentable: `record_response_dispatch` has no `dispatch_result` parameter at all — the field is hardcoded to `"succeeded"` inside the mutator (see §Store mutators). Making the failure state structurally impossible through the success-path method is stronger than a type annotation or documentation rule. See §Store mutators for the signature.

**Why the job terminalizes as `unknown`, not `failed`.** Under OB-1, the plugin does not claim semantic application of an operator decision by App Server. A broken pipe after `dispatched` means the plugin attempted to deliver the operator's decision but does not know whether delivery occurred on the other side (the subprocess may have applied the decision and then crashed, or crashed before the write reached the kernel). The honest terminal status is `unknown` — same status Packet 1 uses for unparseable requests — because further human inspection is required to decide what happened. `failed` would imply a definitive "nothing happened," which we cannot verify.

**What `decide()`'s caller sees.** `decide()` has already returned `DelegationDecisionResult(decision_accepted=True, ...)` before the worker's transport failure — consistent with the async contract (decide acknowledges that the plugin accepted the decision for dispatch; it does NOT claim dispatch succeeded). The caller discovers the failure by polling: `poll()` reports `job.status="unknown"`; the forensic detail (`dispatch_result="failed"`, `dispatch_error=<...>`) lives on the persisted `PendingServerRequest`. This matches the async contract rewrite in §contracts.md §decide.

**Intent durability under failure.** The `approval_resolution.intent` record is already durable before the worker wakes — written by `decide()` pre-`commit_signal` (see §Transactional registry protocol). The subsequent `dispatched`/`completed`/failure records are all local-sequence writes by the worker; if the worker crashes between `dispatched` and `completed`, cold-start recovery writes `completed` with `completion_origin="recovered_unresolved"` and demotes the job. The `dispatch_result="failed"` forensic fact is lost in that sub-case — acceptable because it is a strict subset of the "process crashed" recovery boundary, which is already documented in §Recovery.

**Tests to add:**

- Broken-pipe during respond: induce `RuntimeError` on `session.respond(...)`; verify `record_dispatch_failure` is called with correct fields; verify `poll()` returns `job.status="unknown"` (the only forensic signal exposed via `poll()`); verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid)` (direct store inspection) shows `status="canceled"`, `dispatch_result="failed"`, `dispatch_error` matches sanitization format, `resolved_at=None`. `PendingEscalationView` carries only prompt-rendering fields, so forensic fields are tested via direct store read, not the MCP-visible `poll()` surface.
- Dispatch-failure sentinel raise: verify the handler raises `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="dispatch_failed")` after `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` (not a bare `return`); verify `_execute_live_turn` catches it and returns the stored job directly; verify `_finalize_turn` is NOT invoked for this path; verify the worker runner sees a normal return (not an exception) and does NOT fire `announce_worker_failed` for this branch.
- Atomicity under replay: simulate partial write during the hypothetical two-record sequence; replay must never produce `dispatch_result="failed"` + `status="pending"` simultaneously (the dedicated mutator guarantees one-record atomicity).
- Intent durability preserved under dispatch failure: verify `journal.write_phase(approval_resolution.intent)` was durable before the failure and remains the authority for the operator's decision regardless of dispatch outcome.
- Audit best-effort: simulate audit append failure after dispatch failure; verify the job still terminalizes correctly and a warning is logged (IO-5 semantics preserved).

### Worker-death path (exception during parked section)

```
WORKER raises during park or post-wake:
  try/except around run_execution_turn (delegation_controller.py:730-737)
  catches, calls _mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup:
    - job_store._persist_job_transition(unknown) via existing path
    - _emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed
    - runtime_registry.release
    - session.close
  registry.discard(rid)          # final step added by this design
  re-raises

MAIN (later decide call):
  job = job_store.get(job_id)
  # Status guard fires FIRST (delegation_controller.py:1577, before any
  # registry or pending_request_store lookup):
  job.status == "unknown" → reject via job_not_awaiting_decision
  # Registry is not reached. The worker already discarded its entry during
  # cleanup, so even if the status guard were bypassed, registry.reserve()
  # would return None → request_already_decided; but the status guard
  # always wins the race because it runs before the registry call.
```

### Cold-start reconciliation path

```
PLUGIN INIT:
  recover_startup() runs on main thread before any workers exist.
  For each unresolved approval_resolution idempotency_key:
    write phase="completed" with completion_origin="recovered_unresolved"
  For each orphaned active job (running, needs_escalation):
    demote to "unknown" via _persist_job_transition
    (projection ignores parked_request_id on terminal-status jobs)
```

## Data Model and Store Mutations

### DelegationJob (addition)

```python
parked_request_id: str | None = None
```

Set when worker begins parking; cleared post-respond cleanup. The job's durable selector for projection — answers "which request, if any, is this job's worker currently parked on."

### JobStatus='canceled' propagation (contract expansion)

**Packet 1 expands `JobStatus` from 6 literals to 7** by adding `"canceled"`, and expands `DelegationTerminalStatus` from 3 literals to 4 by adding `"canceled"`. This is a real public-contract addition, not a local pseudocode convention — every guard, map, list, and contract text that enumerates the terminal set must admit `"canceled"`.

**Origin.** `"canceled"` has **two origins** under Packet 1, both producing a verified cancel:

1. The §Timeout path (non-cancel-capable kind) interrupt-succeeded sub-branch (C2-A, sentinel reason `"timeout_interrupt_succeeded"`). Worker terminalizes the job via sentinel bypass before `_finalize_turn` runs; App Server acknowledged `interrupt_turn`.
2. The §Timeout path (cancel-capable kinds) cancel-dispatch-succeeded sub-branch. Worker calls `session.respond({"decision": "cancel"})` successfully, writes `record_timeout(..., dispatch_result="succeeded")` (which sets `request.status="canceled"`), returns `None`, and the main thread reaches `_finalize_turn` with `request_snapshot.status="canceled"`. The §`_finalize_turn` Captured-Request Terminal Guard maps this to `DelegationJob.status="canceled"` per the Request-to-job terminal mapping table.

Both are distinct from `"unknown"` (used for the interrupt-failed sub-branch and for unverified-transport-failure branches) because both origins produce a **verified** cancel — App Server acknowledged either `interrupt_turn` (origin 1) or the worker's `respond({"decision": "cancel"})` dispatch (origin 2). Collapsing either sub-branch to `"unknown"` would erase this forensic distinction — see §Timeout path "Why the split job-status outcome is correct (OB-1 applied)."

**Type-level extension:**

```python
# models.py:21-23 — current:
# JobStatus = Literal[
#     "queued", "running", "needs_escalation", "completed", "failed", "unknown"
# ]

# Packet 1:
JobStatus = Literal[
    "queued", "running", "needs_escalation",
    "completed", "failed", "canceled", "unknown",
]

# models.py:36 — current:
# DelegationTerminalStatus = Literal["completed", "failed", "unknown"]

# Packet 1:
DelegationTerminalStatus = Literal["completed", "failed", "canceled", "unknown"]
```

**Propagation table — exhaustive.** Every enumerated touch point follows. An implementer who adds `"canceled"` without updating all of these rows has left the expansion incomplete.

| Touch point | Current behavior | After C1-A | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| `JobStatus` at `models.py:21-23` | 6 literals | 7 literals (add `"canceled"`) | Primary type extension |
| `DelegationTerminalStatus` at `models.py:36` | 3 literals | 4 literals (add `"canceled"`) | Canceled is terminal for delegation outcome purposes |
| `_TERMINAL_STATUS_MAP` at `delegation_controller.py:104-108` | 3 entries | 4 entries — add `"canceled": "canceled"` | `_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed` gates on this map; a missing entry means canceled jobs silently skip `DelegationOutcomeRecord` emission |
| `_load_or_materialize_inspection` guard at `delegation_controller.py:873` | `("completed", "failed", "unknown")` returns artifact snapshot | Tuple: `("completed", "failed", "canceled", "unknown")`. For `"canceled"` specifically: return `None` without calling `_artifact_store.materialize_snapshot` or `_artifact_store.reconstruct_from_artifacts`. Canceled jobs have no artifacts — the worker was interrupted before artifacts could be produced. | Terminal guard must admit `"canceled"` (otherwise the main-thread-writes-to-terminal-job invariant at §Named Invariants is false), but the artifact surface is empty |
| `_ACTIVE_STATUSES` at `delegation_job_store.py:22` | `{"queued", "running", "needs_escalation"}` | No change — `"canceled"` is TERMINAL, NOT active. The existing explicit note at `:19-22` says "Manually curated subset ... Adding a new JobStatus should be an explicit decision about whether it counts as active." This decision: NOT active. | Busy-gate semantics unchanged — canceled jobs do not keep the session busy |
| `list_active()` at `delegation_job_store.py:66-69` | Returns active statuses | No change (canceled not in `_ACTIVE_STATUSES`) | Consistent with active-vs-terminal split |
| `list_user_attention_required()` at `delegation_job_store.py:71-89` | Filters by promotion_state + excludes completed-with-null-promotion_state | Add explicit treatment: `"canceled"` jobs are INCLUDED regardless of promotion_state. The `completed + null promotion_state` exclusion does not apply to `"canceled"` because canceled jobs never enter the promotion lifecycle (a canceled turn produced no artifacts to promote). | UX: the delegate skill must surface canceled jobs so the operator can retry or dismiss them; excluding them would hide timed-out delegations from attention |
| `discard()` gate at `delegation_controller.py:1404-1406` | Discardable when `promotion_state in ("pending", "prechecks_failed")` OR `status in ("failed", "unknown")` with null promotion_state | Expand the status branch to `status in ("failed", "unknown", "canceled")` with null promotion_state. Canceled jobs never enter the promotion lifecycle (same reason as the `list_user_attention_required` row), so the null-promotion-state predicate trivially holds for them; a canceled job that has somehow acquired a non-null promotion_state still rejects with `job_not_discardable` under the existing rule. | Closes the dismiss path the `list_user_attention_required` row above promises. Without this, the `retry-or-dismiss` UX claim is false — canceled jobs would sit on the attention surface indefinitely with no close path |
| `_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed` at `delegation_controller.py:801-823` | Emits `DelegationOutcomeRecord` when `_TERMINAL_STATUS_MAP.get(job.status)` is non-None | Automatic after `_TERMINAL_STATUS_MAP` gains `"canceled"` — no separate code change needed | Analytics: canceled jobs produce terminal outcome records with `terminal_status="canceled"` |
| Cold-start recovery (`recover_startup` at `delegation_controller.py:1789+`) | Demotes `running` jobs to `"unknown"` | No change — `"canceled"` is terminal, so the existing active-job scan never touches it | Recovery treats canceled as a final outcome (do NOT demote to unknown) |
| Contracts `contracts.md:73` DelegationJob.status enum | 6 literals | 7 literals (add `"canceled"`) | Public contract consistency |
| Contracts `contracts.md:379` active_delegation.status enum | 6 literals | 7 literals (add `"canceled"`) | Public contract consistency — delegate skill's status-routing table must account for canceled |
| Spec §poll() state machine | `needs_escalation → running → completed \| failed \| unknown` | `needs_escalation → running → completed \| failed \| canceled \| unknown` | Observable state machine |
| Spec §Projection helpers' terminal guards at `_project_pending_escalation` | `("completed", "failed", "unknown")` | Add `"canceled"` | Consistent with the terminal split |
| Spec §Worker terminal-branch signaling primitive invariant checklist | 5 rows | 6 rows (see table in that section — added `timeout_interrupt_succeeded` row) | Sentinel primitive admits the canceled-terminalization branch |

**Decision log (why each entry is what it is):**

- **Why add to `DelegationTerminalStatus`:** we want `DelegationOutcomeRecord.terminal_status="canceled"` to be a first-class value that analytics can aggregate distinctly from `"unknown"`. If we left `DelegationTerminalStatus` at 3 literals and added `"canceled"` only to `JobStatus`, `_TERMINAL_STATUS_MAP.get("canceled")` would return `None` and outcome emission would silently skip canceled jobs.
- **Why NOT add to `_ACTIVE_STATUSES`:** the active-statuses set is the complement of terminal for busy-gate purposes. Canceled jobs have a finalized outcome (the turn was interrupted; no further progress is possible); they should not keep the session busy.
- **Why include in `list_user_attention_required()`:** the delegate skill's UX needs to show the operator "this delegation timed out — here is the cancel record, do you want to retry?" If canceled jobs are excluded, the operator only discovers them by browsing the full list, which violates the "attention required" surface's purpose.
- **Why expand `discard()` to admit `"canceled"`:** `list_user_attention_required` surfaces canceled jobs so the operator can "retry or dismiss." Retry spawns a new delegation and does not close the old one; dismiss is `discard()`. If the discard gate keeps rejecting canceled, the "dismiss" half of the UX promise is unbacked and canceled jobs pile up on the attention surface with no close path. The expansion is the symmetric corollary of admitting canceled into the attention surface in the first place — refusing one without the other produces a dead-end UX state.
- **Why `_load_or_materialize_inspection` returns `None` for canceled:** the existing logic at `:893` calls `materialize_snapshot` if the cache miss branch triggers. For canceled, there is nothing to materialize (no turn-produced artifacts). Returning `None` early matches the behavior for jobs that are terminal but never produced a reviewable result.
- **Why lineage is `"completed"` (not `"canceled"`) for the canceled-terminalization branch:** `CollaborationHandle.status` is a separate lifecycle ("lineage layer"). For the canceled branch, the lineage handle's turn sequence ran to a clean cancel — no in-flight ambiguity — so the lineage records `"completed"`. Only the `DelegationJob.status` carries the cancel-specific forensic information. The lineage-vs-job split mirrors the existing unknown-terminalization pattern (`_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` sets both to `"unknown"`), except the canceled split is asymmetric (job=`"canceled"`, lineage=`"completed"`) because cancel is verifiable.

**`CollaborationHandle.status` is NOT expanded.** Lineage continues to use its existing 3-literal set (`"active"`, `"completed"`, `"unknown"`). Adding `"canceled"` to lineage would require separate propagation through every lineage-layer touch point, and the asymmetric mapping above shows it is not needed for Packet 1 forensic correctness.

**Migration notes (JSONL replay safety):**

- Pre-Packet-1 `delegation_jobs/{session_id}/jobs.jsonl` records have no `status="canceled"` entries — no replay anomalies possible from historical data.
- Post-Packet-1 records with `status="canceled"` are replayed by existing `DelegationJobStore` logic unchanged — the `_VALID_STATUSES` frozenset is computed from `get_args(JobStatus)` at import time, so adding to the `Literal` definition automatically widens the validator.
- `_VALID_STATUSES` does NOT need a manual update — the explicit `get_args(JobStatus)` derivation at `delegation_job_store.py:17` handles it.

**Tests to add (beyond existing §Timeout path interrupt-succeeded test at `:2001-2004`):**

- **DelegationJobStore accepts `canceled`:** construct a `DelegationJob` with `status="canceled"` and call `create()` / `update_status()`; both should succeed (no `ValueError: unknown status`).
- **`list_active()` excludes canceled:** insert a canceled job; verify `list_active()` does not return it.
- **`list_user_attention_required()` includes canceled:** insert a canceled job with null promotion_state; verify `list_user_attention_required()` returns it.
- **`discard(canceled_job)` succeeds when promotion_state is null:** insert a canceled job with `promotion_state=None`; call `discard(job_id=<id>)`; verify the result is `DiscardResult(job=<updated>)` and the updated job carries `promotion_state="discarded"`; verify an `audit.action="discard"` event was appended. Repeat with `promotion_state="applied"` (any non-null value); verify rejection with `DiscardRejectedResponse(reason="job_not_discardable")` — same rule as `failed`/`unknown` (canceled does not override the post-mutation discardability restriction).
- **`_load_or_materialize_inspection(canceled_job)` returns `None` without materializing:** spy on `_artifact_store.materialize_snapshot` / `reconstruct_from_artifacts`; insert a canceled job; verify inspection returns `None` and the spies were NOT called.
- **`_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed(canceled_job_id)` writes `DelegationOutcomeRecord` with `terminal_status="canceled"`:** assert the journal receives the outcome record with the correct terminal status literal.
- **Cold-start recovery does not demote canceled:** simulate a session restart with a canceled job in the store; verify `recover_startup` does NOT mutate the job's status.
- **contracts.md reflects the expansion:** a documentation-layer assertion (the delegate skill's status-routing table enumerates canceled) that can be validated by a spec-level schema reader or a human review checkpoint.

### PendingServerRequest (additions)

All new fields are nullable / have safe defaults. Back-compatible: existing records read as all-None on new fields.

| Field | Type | Default | Set by | Set when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `resolution_action` | `Literal["approve", "deny"] \| None` | `None` | Worker (on wake from real decide) | Before respond dispatch |
| `response_payload` | `dict[str, Any] \| None` | `None` | Worker | At dispatch (for kinds with a payload; None for interrupted-path) |
| `response_dispatch_at` | `str \| None` | `None` | Worker | Immediately before respond() call |
| `dispatch_result` | `Literal["succeeded", "failed"] \| None` | `None` | Worker | Immediately after respond() returns or raises |
| `dispatch_error` | `str \| None` | `None` | Worker | Only when `dispatch_result="failed"`; sanitized + bounded (see §Observability sanitization rules) |
| `interrupt_error` | `str \| None` | `None` | Worker | Only on non-cancel-capable timeout path when `session.interrupt_turn` raises; sanitized + bounded (see §Observability sanitization rules). Always paired with `timed_out=True`; never set alongside `dispatch_error`. |
| `resolved_at` | `str \| None` | `None` | Worker | Only on success transition to `status="resolved"` |
| `protocol_echo_signals` | `tuple[str, ...]` | `()` | Worker | Post-turn, via promoted `_verify_post_turn_signals` |
| `protocol_echo_observed_at` | `str \| None` | `None` | Worker | Post-turn with `protocol_echo_signals` |
| `timed_out` | `bool` | `False` | Worker | Iff resolution came from registry timer, not decide() |
| `internal_abort_reason` | `str \| None` | `None` | Worker | Only on internal-abort wake (see §Internal abort coordination); sanitized + bounded (see §Observability sanitization rules) |

`resolution_action` is strictly operator-fact (what `decide()` specified). `timed_out` is strictly circumstance-fact. `dispatch_result` is strictly transport-fact for `session.respond()` on the success-or-cancel-dispatch path. `dispatch_error` is the forensic annotation tied to `dispatch_result="failed"`. `interrupt_error` is the forensic annotation tied to `session.interrupt_turn()` transport failure on the non-cancel-capable timeout path; it is always paired with `timed_out=True` and is mutually exclusive with `dispatch_error` (the two fields annotate different transport surfaces). `internal_abort_reason` is the plugin-invariant-violation annotation tied to the internal-abort path; it is orthogonal to the four axes above and is never set alongside `resolution_action`, `dispatch_result`, `timed_out`, `dispatch_error`, or `interrupt_error`. Keeping the axes orthogonal means any audit query asks exactly what it means to ask.

### PendingRequestStatus (unchanged)

Existing enum `Literal["pending", "resolved", "canceled"]` at `packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/models.py:20` is sufficient. Successful resolution → `resolved` (via `mark_resolved`). Timeouts → `canceled` (via `record_timeout`, atomic). Dispatch failures → `canceled` (via `record_dispatch_failure`, atomic — see §Dispatch failure path).

### OperationJournalEntry (addition)

```python
completion_origin: Literal["worker_completed", "recovered_unresolved"] | None = None
```

Provenance annotation on the terminal `phase="completed"` marker. Values:
- `"worker_completed"`: worker wrote the completed record. Covers both successful dispatch and worker-handled failure paths (e.g., dispatch failure at §Dispatch failure path); distinguishes worker-origin completions from recovery-origin ones. Transport outcome (success vs failure) is carried by `PendingServerRequest.dispatch_result`, not by this field.
- `"recovered_unresolved"`: cold-start recovery wrote the completed record to close an orphaned unresolved operation.
- `None`: legacy records written before this schema change (back-compat read semantics).

Narrowly scoped to journal provenance. Timeouts, failures, and dispatch errors are recorded on the `PendingServerRequest` record and/or audit events — not here.

### EscalatableRequestKind (new literal) + `PendingEscalationView.kind` narrowing

Packet 1's behavior is that `kind="unknown"` never surfaces to the operator as an escalation (see §Unknown-kind contract). Today the public view admits it anyway — `PendingEscalationView.kind: PendingRequestKind` at `models.py:449-450` permits all four literals. Packet 1 introduces a narrower literal type used exclusively by the escalation projection:

```python
# packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/models.py — addition
EscalatableRequestKind = Literal[
    "command_approval",
    "file_change",
    "request_user_input",
]

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class PendingEscalationView:
    request_id: str
    kind: EscalatableRequestKind          # narrowed from PendingRequestKind
    requested_scope: dict[str, Any]
    available_decisions: tuple[str, ...] = ()
```

`PendingRequestKind` at `models.py:16-18` stays unchanged — `"unknown"` is still a valid *persisted* request kind in `PendingRequestStore` (where it records parse-failure audit trails). The split encodes the semantic distinction the Packet 1 behavior requires: `"unknown"` is a persisted request kind but NOT an escalatable request kind.

The narrowing is enforced at the **constructor boundary** — `_project_request_to_view` raises `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` if `request.kind` is not in the escalatable set. This catches every Packet 1 path that constructs a `PendingEscalationView` — `_project_pending_escalation` (called by `poll()` and by `start()`'s escalation-return branch), plus any future caller that routes through `_project_request_to_view` — without relying on callers to remember the guard. In Packet 1, `decide()` returns the new 3-field `DelegationDecisionResult` and has no projection callsite of its own; placing the runtime check at the constructor means a later packet that re-introduces projection in `decide()` (or anywhere else) inherits the guard by construction. See §Projection helper rewrites for the full guard pseudocode and per-callsite recovery semantics. Type-level enforcement via `EscalatableRequestKind` catches most violations at mypy time; the runtime assertion is a belt-and-suspenders check for callsites that bypass the type system (e.g., `dict[str, Any]`-shaped constructor inputs from JSONL replay paths).

`contracts.md:332` tightens its `kind` enum to match the three-literal list — see §contracts.md updates.

### Store mutators

**PendingRequestStore additions:**

```python
def record_response_dispatch(
    self,
    request_id: str,
    *,
    action: Literal["approve", "deny"],
    payload: dict[str, Any],
    dispatch_at: str,
) -> None:
    # Append {"op": "record_response_dispatch", ...}; replay handles new op type.
    # Success-path mutator only. The failure and timeout paths route through
    # `record_dispatch_failure` and `record_timeout`, which are atomic
    # mutators that also set `status="canceled"` in the same record
    # (see §Dispatch failure path and §Timeout path).
    # Populates: resolution_action, response_payload, response_dispatch_at,
    # and dispatch_result (hardcoded to "succeeded" inside this mutator —
    # no caller-provided dimension; the parameter was removed to make the
    # failure state structurally unrepresentable through this method).

def mark_resolved(self, request_id: str, resolved_at: str) -> None:
    # Append {"op": "mark_resolved", ...}
    # Populates: status="resolved", resolved_at

def record_protocol_echo(
    self,
    request_id: str,
    *,
    signals: tuple[str, ...],
    observed_at: str,
) -> None:
    # Append {"op": "record_protocol_echo", ...}
    # Populates: protocol_echo_signals, protocol_echo_observed_at

def record_timeout(
    self,
    request_id: str,
    *,
    response_payload: dict[str, Any] | None,
    response_dispatch_at: str | None,
    dispatch_result: Literal["succeeded", "failed"] | None,
    dispatch_error: str | None,
    interrupt_error: str | None = None,
) -> None:
    # Append {"op": "record_timeout", ...}
    # Populates: timed_out=True; dispatch fields per path:
    #   - Interrupted (non-cancel-capable) path, interrupt succeeded:
    #     payload=None, at=None, result=None, error=None, interrupt_error=None
    #   - Interrupted (non-cancel-capable) path, interrupt raised:
    #     payload=None, at=None, result=None, error=None,
    #     interrupt_error=<sanitized bounded string; see §Observability>
    #   - Cancel-capable success path:
    #     payload=cancel, at=<iso>, result="succeeded", error=None, interrupt_error=None
    #   - Cancel-capable failure path (respond raised — see §Timeout path):
    #     payload=cancel, at=<iso>, result="failed",
    #     error=<sanitized bounded string>, interrupt_error=None
    # Also emits status transition to "canceled" atomically via the same op.
    # interrupt_error and dispatch_error are mutually exclusive by construction
    # (different transport surfaces: interrupt_turn vs respond).

def record_dispatch_failure(
    self,
    request_id: str,
    *,
    action: Literal["approve", "deny"],
    payload: dict[str, Any],
    dispatch_at: str,
    dispatch_error: str,
) -> None:
    # Append {"op": "record_dispatch_failure", ...}; replay handles new op type.
    # ATOMIC write: populates all of the following in a single record so replay
    # can never observe an inconsistent intermediate (see §Dispatch failure path):
    #   resolution_action = action
    #   response_payload = payload
    #   response_dispatch_at = dispatch_at
    #   dispatch_result = "failed"
    #   dispatch_error = <sanitized, bounded — see §Observability sanitization rules>
    #   status = "canceled"
    #   resolved_at = None                  # NOT resolved — dispatch did not deliver

def record_internal_abort(
    self,
    request_id: str,
    *,
    reason: str,
) -> None:
    # Append {"op": "record_internal_abort", ...}; replay handles new op type.
    # ATOMIC write: populates all of the following in a single record so replay
    # can never observe an inconsistent intermediate (see §Internal abort
    # coordination):
    #   status = "canceled"
    #   internal_abort_reason = <sanitized, bounded — see §Observability>
    #   resolution_action = None            # no operator decision was made
    #   response_payload = None             # no dispatch occurred
    #   response_dispatch_at = None
    #   dispatch_result = None
    #   resolved_at = None                  # NOT resolved — aborted
    # timed_out remains False (this is not a timeout; reason names the cause).
```

Dedicated methods, not a generic `update(**fields)`. Matches existing store style at `pending_request_store.py:29-69` and keeps replay's `op` dispatch enumerable. `record_timeout`, `record_dispatch_failure`, and `record_internal_abort` are structurally parallel: each captures a terminal circumstance (timer fired / transport raised / plugin-invariant violation) plus the `status="canceled"` transition in a single atomic append. Each mutator anchors on one primary circumstance axis — `record_timeout` on `timed_out`, `record_dispatch_failure` on `dispatch_result`, `record_internal_abort` on `internal_abort_reason` — and those three primary axes are mutually exclusive by construction, so any audit query that joins on them never conflates the causes. `record_timeout` additionally writes the `interrupt_error` sub-axis when `session.interrupt_turn` raises on the non-cancel path; that sub-axis is always paired with `timed_out=True` (the anchoring invariant) and is mutually exclusive with `dispatch_error` — the two annotate different transport surfaces (interrupt vs. respond). See §Observability field-orthogonality paragraph for the full axis table.

**DelegationJobStore addition:**

```python
def update_parked_request(
    self, job_id: str, request_id: str | None,
) -> None:
    # Append {"op": "update_parked_request", "request_id": rid | null}; replay handles new op
```

### Session API addition

`AppServerRuntimeSession` grows one method to let the `_server_request_handler` closure call `respond()` directly (enabling the worker to own the dispatch sequence including stores updates) while still returning `None` to suppress the notification loop's auto-respond at `runtime.py:246-248`:

```python
# packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/runtime.py — addition
def respond(self, request_id: str | int, result: dict[str, Any]) -> None:
    """Dispatch a response to a server-initiated request."""
    self._client.respond(request_id, result)
```

Thin delegation to `JsonRpcClient.respond` at `jsonrpc_client.py:106-130`. Exposed on the session so callers don't reach into `_client` directly.

### Replay logic

Each store's `_replay()` method extends with branches for new op types. Existing pattern at `pending_request_store.py:77-137`:

- `record_response_dispatch` → set `resolution_action`, `response_payload`, `response_dispatch_at`, `dispatch_result="succeeded"`
- `mark_resolved` → set `status="resolved"` and `resolved_at`
- `record_protocol_echo` → set `protocol_echo_signals`, `protocol_echo_observed_at`
- `record_timeout` → set `timed_out=True`, dispatch fields if provided (`response_payload`, `response_dispatch_at`, `dispatch_result`, `dispatch_error`), `interrupt_error` if provided, `status="canceled"`
- `record_dispatch_failure` → set `resolution_action`, `response_payload`, `response_dispatch_at`, `dispatch_result="failed"`, `dispatch_error`, `status="canceled"`, `resolved_at=None`
- `record_internal_abort` → set `status="canceled"`, `internal_abort_reason`, `resolution_action=None`, `response_payload=None`, `response_dispatch_at=None`, `dispatch_result=None`, `resolved_at=None`
- `update_parked_request` (on job store) → set `parked_request_id` to value or None

Unknown op types in logs from future migrations are skipped (graceful-read per existing pattern at `pending_request_store.py:87-90`).

## decide() and poll() Contract Changes

### DelegationDecisionResult — new shape (breaking)

Current definition at `models.py:418-426`:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DelegationDecisionResult:
    job: DelegationJob
    decision: DecisionAction
    resumed: bool
    pending_escalation: PendingEscalationView | None = None
    agent_context: str | None = None
```

New definition:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class DelegationDecisionResult:
    decision_accepted: bool
    job_id: str
    request_id: str
```

All five previous fields are removed. The caller observes live state via `poll()`.

### decide() semantics

- Returns after, in strict order:
  1. Validating args (existing logic at `delegation_controller.py:1620-1649`).
  2. `registry.reserve(request_id, resolution)` — atomic CAS `awaiting → reserved`. If None, reject with `request_already_decided` and return without any further side effects.
  3. Writing `approval_resolution.intent` to the operation journal (existing write at `delegation_controller.py:1666-1679`; kept). If this raises, `abort_reservation(token)` restores `awaiting` and the exception re-raises to the caller.
  4. `registry.commit_signal(token)` — fires the per-entry event and transitions `reserved → consuming`. Irreversible.
  5. Appending `approve` / `deny` audit event via `journal.append_audit_event` (existing at `:1680-1692`; kept). **Post-commit, non-gating:** audit failure is logged as a warning and does not affect the return value. Audit is best-effort per IO-5.

- **Ordering rationale.** Step 3 (durable journal intent) must precede step 4 (worker wake) because the worker will immediately write `dispatched` and `completed` after wake; a late-arriving `intent` would violate file-order monotonicity of the `approval_resolution` idempotency key (see §Resolution registry → Ordering guarantees). Step 5 (audit) lives outside the critical section because IO-5 makes audit non-durable; gating the worker wake on a non-durable write would introduce a "ghost intent" failure mode under crash (see §Transactional registry protocol → "Why audit lives outside the transaction").

- **Failure recovery semantics:** the reservation is rollback-safe up to and including a raised journal-intent write. After journal-intent durably lands, the operation is committed from the authority perspective; `commit_signal` must succeed (it is a local state mutation + `threading.Event.set()`; failure is a plugin-critical bug rather than a recoverable error).

- The `approval_resolution.dispatched` write at `:1693-1708` **moves to the worker thread** — `decide()` no longer writes it.

- The verb is "accepted for dispatch," not "applied." Dispatch to Codex App Server happens asynchronously on the worker thread after wake. Observation of dispatch outcome is via `poll()` + audit events.

### Response payload mapping (plugin decision → App Server payload)

The `resolution` object that `decide()` claims into the registry carries the **App Server response payload** that the worker will pass to `session.respond(request_id, payload)`. The mapping from plugin-side decision verb to App Server payload is kind-sensitive. This table is the authoritative contract for Packet 1.

| Plugin decision | `command_approval` | `file_change` | `request_user_input` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `approve` | `{"decision": "accept"}` | `{"decision": "accept"}` | `{"answers": <validated answers dict>}` |
| `deny` | `{"decision": "decline"}` | `{"decision": "decline"}` | `{"answers": {}}` — *known-denial fallback*, see note |
| timeout (synthetic, cancel-capable) | `{"decision": "cancel"}` | `{"decision": "cancel"}` | N/A — uses `interrupt_turn`, no payload dispatched |
| timeout (synthetic, non-cancel-capable) | N/A | N/A | `interrupt_turn` only, no payload dispatched |

**Semantics of each App Server decision (per `docs/codex-app-server.md:986, 996`):**

- `{"decision": "accept"}` — operator approved this specific action; App Server proceeds with it.
- `{"decision": "decline"}` — operator declined this specific action; App Server does not execute it but does not abort the turn. The terminal `item/completed` will carry `status: "declined"`.
- `{"decision": "cancel"}` — operator or system is aborting; App Server cancels the turn. Reserved in Packet 1 for timeout/abort paths, **not** user-initiated deny.

**`request_user_input` response-payload provenance (implementation-gate).** The mapping `approve → {"answers": <validated answers dict>}` is **plugin-assumed**, NOT documented in the App Server spec. The citations currently in this section (`docs/codex-app-server.md:986, 996, 1002-1004`) pin the `{"decision": "..."}` shape for `command_approval` / `file_change` and the post-response `serverRequest/resolved` emission shape `{threadId, requestId}` for `request_user_input`; they do NOT document the client → server response payload shape for `request_user_input`. The only `request_user_input` response shape demonstrated in existing plugin code is the empty-answers denial fallback at `delegation_controller.py:720` (`return {"answers": {}}`); non-empty answers have never been exercised against App Server. Implementers MUST verify the wire shape for non-empty-answers approve — either via a live App Server fixture/probe, by reading App Server source, or by an equivalent ground-truth check — before shipping the approve-with-answers branch of `decide()`. This is a Packet 1 acceptance-criterion: the implementation plan's request_user_input approve-answers phase cannot be marked complete without the verification artifact on file (fixture, source cite, or integration test against a pinned App Server version). If verification reveals the shape differs from `{"answers": <dict>}` (e.g., the client-response channel actually uses `{"content": <dict>}` or the MCP-elicitation-style `{"action": "accept", "content": ...}` shape documented at `docs/codex-app-server.md:1010+`), the mapping table and §decide() validation both require update before implementation proceeds. Packet 2+ may negotiate a narrower contract with App Server for this kind.

**Why `deny → decline` (not `cancel`) for command/file kinds:**

- `deny` is a per-action operator decision, not an abort of the delegated turn. `decline` has that exact semantic in the App Server contract.
- `cancel` is reserved for circumstance-driven paths (timeout, lifecycle cleanup, abort). Keeping the mapping axis-clean means the request record's `resolution_action="deny"` and `timed_out=False` combination maps to `{"decision": "decline"}`, while `resolution_action=None` and `timed_out=True` maps to `{"decision": "cancel"}` — no cross-axis conflation.
- The terminal `item/completed` then carries `status: "declined"` for operator-deny and `status: "failed"` / `"completed"` for timeout-cancel, preserving downstream ability to distinguish.
- A future product-level "deny and abort the whole delegated turn" semantics, if needed, would be a separate plugin action (e.g., `deny_and_abort`) or an explicit policy flag — **not** hidden behind `deny`.

**Note on `request_user_input` + `deny`:**

The `request_user_input` request kind has no App Server-native `{"decision": ...}` channel; the App Server docs at `docs/codex-app-server.md:1002-1004` pin the post-response `serverRequest/resolved` emission shape but do NOT pin the client-response payload shape itself — the `{"answers": ...}` shape is plugin-assumed based on the existing known-denial fallback at `delegation_controller.py:720` (`return {"answers": {}}`), which is the only `request_user_input` response shape currently exercised. Packet 1 preserves this empty-answers fallback for operator `deny` on this kind because it re-uses an already-exercised wire shape (no new implementation-gate required for the deny branch). The approve-with-non-empty-answers branch is gated by the implementation-verification requirement documented above (see **`request_user_input` response-payload provenance**). Packet 1 preserves this behavior for operator `deny` on this kind:

- It is **not** an App Server-native "decline" — the App Server contract does not offer one for this kind.
- It is **not** a "cancel" — a cancel on `request_user_input` would mean aborting the turn, not declining the specific input.
- It **is** the empty-answers fallback that the codebase already relies on. Future work (Packet 2+) may negotiate a proper denial contract with App Server for this kind; until then, the Packet 1 behavior is an explicit known-limitation mapping.

The `PendingServerRequest` record after a `deny` on `request_user_input` still sets `resolution_action="deny"` (operator-fact) and `response_payload={"answers": {}}` (transport-fact). Audit queries distinguish "operator denied" from "operator approved with empty answers" via `resolution_action`, which `response_payload` alone cannot disambiguate.

**Payload construction happens on the main thread** (inside `decide()` before `registry.reserve(...)`) — not on the worker. Rationale: validation lives in `decide()` anyway (`delegation_controller.py:1620-1649` validates `answers` for `request_user_input`); constructing the payload adjacent to validation keeps the error surface narrow. The worker receives a fully-formed payload in the `Resolution` object and dispatches it via `session.respond(...)` without further shaping.

**`kind="unknown"` is not in the mapping table.** Unknown-kind requests never reach the decide flow in Packet 1 — they are captured for audit, interrupt the turn, and terminalize the job. See §Unknown-kind contract (explicit behavior change) for the full rationale and the specific rejection reason `decide()` returns if a caller tries anyway.

### Unknown-kind contract (explicit behavior change from current code)

**Current behavior (pre-Packet 1, what Packet 1 replaces):** The D4 carve-out at `delegation_controller.py:671-688` creates a minimal `PendingServerRequest` with `kind="unknown"` when server-request parsing fails. The post-turn path at `:1473-1478` routes `interrupted_by_unknown = True` to `final_status = "needs_escalation"`. The branch at `:1482-1510` emits an `escalate` audit event and returns a `DelegationEscalation` with the unknown request projected as a caller-visible pending escalation. The operator is then expected to call `decide()` on a request the plugin could not even parse.

**Why this is a problem under Packet 1's model:** deferred approval assumes the plugin can construct a meaningful App Server response payload on the worker's behalf. Packet 1's §Response payload mapping table (approve → `{"decision": "accept"}`, etc.) requires a known request kind. For `kind="unknown"`, the plugin has no parseable `itemId`, `threadId`, or `commandActions` — nothing to respond to. Even if the operator said "approve," the worker would have nothing to dispatch.

**Packet 1 behavior (explicit change):**

| Step | Current | Packet 1 |
|---|---|---|
| Parse failure in handler | Create `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` for audit | Same — preserve audit trail |
| Turn behavior | Handler calls `interrupt_turn` (at `:690-695`); flags `interrupted_by_unknown` | Same — still interrupts |
| Job status derivation | `final_status = "needs_escalation"` (at `:1473`) | `final_status = "unknown"` (terminal) |
| Caller-visible | `DelegationEscalation` with pending_escalation projection (at `:1504-1510`) | Plain `DelegationJob` with `status="unknown"`. The persisted `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` at `:671-688` is the causal record of the parse failure; `DelegationOutcomeRecord` remains the ordinary terminal analytics record (not extended by Packet 1 to carry `reason`/`request_id`). |
| Registry | Request registered, worker parks, escalation surfaces | Request NEVER registered, NEVER parked, NEVER announce_parked-ed |
| `decide()` on this request | Proceeds as if the operator can decide | Rejects with `job_not_awaiting_decision` (job is terminal, not awaiting) |
| Timeout diagrams | (timeout path applies) | N/A — no parked state |

**Rationale for rejection reason:** the request *does* exist in the pending request store (parse-failure record was created for audit), but the JOB is terminal (`unknown`). `request_not_found` is wrong because the request is persisted. `request_job_mismatch` is wrong because the request and job correlate correctly. `job_not_awaiting_decision` is correct: the job is not in `needs_escalation`, so no decision applies.

**Callsite change summary:**

- `delegation_controller.py:1473` — change `if captured_request.kind in _CANCEL_CAPABLE_KINDS or interrupted_by_unknown:` to match only `_CANCEL_CAPABLE_KINDS`; handle `interrupted_by_unknown` on a separate branch that routes to `final_status = "unknown"`.
- `delegation_controller.py:1482-1510` — the `if final_status == "needs_escalation":` branch must not fire for unknown-kind terminations. Instead, the `interrupted_by_unknown` path flows to the non-escalation return at `:1512-1517` (`_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed`, release runtime, close session, return the `unknown`-terminal job).
- `delegation_controller.py` worker path — the new worker sequence (Packet 1) does NOT call `registry.register` or `registry.announce_parked` when the captured request has `kind="unknown"`. Instead, after the existing `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` audit-trail record is created (at `:671-688`) and the turn is interrupted (at `:690-695`), the worker persists the job as terminal via `_persist_job_transition` with `status="unknown"`, then signals `registry.announce_turn_terminal_without_escalation(job_id, status="unknown", reason="unknown_kind_parse_failure", request_id=<persisted_request_id>)`. Neither `announce_worker_failed` nor `announce_turn_completed_empty` is used for this path: the former implies a worker-side exception (which this is not — the worker correctly handled unparseable input), and the latter implies analytical completion (which this is not — the turn was interrupted on parse failure). The new signal causes `start()` to return a plain `DelegationJob` with `status="unknown"` (on the existing `DelegationJob | DelegationEscalation | JobBusyResponse` union — no new wrapper is introduced) rather than raising `DelegationStartError`.
- Recovery code at `:2036-2038` already demotes `needs_escalation` jobs to `unknown` on restart; under Packet 1 these jobs never reach `needs_escalation` in the first place, so recovery treats them as already-terminal.

**Operator-facing effect:** under Packet 1, a parse-failed request surfaces to the operator as "delegation failed" (job terminal, status=`unknown`) — not as "please approve or deny this action." The causal failure context lives on the persisted `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` audit entry (at `controller:671-688`); `DelegationOutcomeRecord` remains the ordinary terminal analytics record with its existing shape (`models.py:227-244`) and is NOT extended by Packet 1 to carry `reason`/`request_id`. This is strictly more honest than the pre-Packet-1 behavior — the plugin cannot render the action in the first place, so asking the operator to decide on it is misleading.

**Tests to add:**

- Integration: server-request parse failure → turn interrupted → job terminalized as `unknown` → no escalation surfaces → `decide()` on the persisted-for-audit request rejects with `job_not_awaiting_decision`.
- Regression: the prior `interrupted_by_unknown → escalation` path is intentionally removed; test that it no longer fires.
- Unknown-kind interrupt transport failure (Edge-D): stage a parse failure so the handler reaches the interrupt step; monkeypatch `session.interrupt_turn(...)` to raise `RuntimeError("broken pipe")`; verify the handler catches it, calls `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup(...)` exactly once, and raises `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure")`; verify `_execute_live_turn` re-raises as `DelegationStartError(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure", cause=None)`; verify the worker runner fires `announce_worker_failed(job_id, exc)` with this exception; verify `start()` raises `DelegationStartError(reason="unknown_kind_interrupt_transport_failure")` — NOT `reason="worker_failed_before_capture"` (reason-preservation rule). Verify the `PendingServerRequest(kind="unknown")` audit record persisted before the interrupt attempt remains in the store (partial-capture is preserved; `decide()` on this rid would return `job_not_awaiting_decision`). Verify NO `announce_turn_terminal_without_escalation` signal fired (the full unknown-kind sequence aborted at step 2).

### `_finalize_turn` Captured-Request Terminal Guard

**Why this guard exists.** Pre-Packet-1, `_finalize_turn` could safely treat `captured_request.kind in _CANCEL_CAPABLE_KINDS` as the escalation signal, because `decide()` was synchronous: the finalizer only ran for paths where the operator had not yet decided, so capturing a cancel-capable request reliably meant "needs escalation." Under Packet 1's async-decide model, the worker thread resolves the captured request BEFORE the main thread's `_finalize_turn` runs — on the decide-success path (worker calls `mark_resolved`) and on the timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded path (worker calls `record_timeout(..., dispatch_result="succeeded")`). A kind-only check wrongly re-escalates a request whose terminal state the worker has already written.

Concrete breakage if the guard is absent:

- **Happy decide-success on `command_approval` or `file_change`:** worker calls `mark_resolved`, clears `parked_request_id`, returns `None`. `_run_turn` continues to `turn/completed(status="completed")`. `_finalize_turn` sees `captured_request.kind in _CANCEL_CAPABLE_KINDS` and wrongly sets `final_status="needs_escalation"`, overwriting the successful dispatch with a phantom escalation.
- **Timeout-cancel-dispatch-success on `command_approval` or `file_change`:** worker calls `record_timeout(..., dispatch_result="succeeded")`, sets request `status="canceled"`, clears `parked_request_id`, returns `None`. `_run_turn` continues to `turn/completed(status="interrupted")`. `_finalize_turn` wrongly sets `final_status="needs_escalation"`, silently discarding the verified cancel.

**The rule — one authoritative snapshot.** `_finalize_turn`'s captured-request branch performs **exactly one** request-status read at the top of the branch, and that single snapshot is the authority for final-status derivation:

```python
request_snapshot = pending_request_store.get(captured_request.request_id)
# request_snapshot.status is the authoritative input for BOTH
# the D4 blind-write suppression decision AND the terminal-guard
# status mapping. No second read may feed either decision.
```

**The one-snapshot invariant:** only one request-status read may participate in final-status derivation. Later reads are permitted only for return-shape hydration (non-status fields such as `resolved_at`, `dispatch_result`, `protocol_echo_*`) and must not feed the terminal-guard decision. This invariant prevents the R14 ordering bug in which a D4 mutation written between a first read (for D4 gating) and a second read (for status derivation) would corrupt the derivation: specifically, a `pending` request with non-None `captured_request.kind` would otherwise be promoted to `resolved` by D4 and then misclassified as `completed`/`unknown` by a post-D4 re-read, bypassing the `pending` fall-through.

**The derivation:** if `request_snapshot.status` is terminal (`resolved` or `canceled`), the finalizer derives `final_status` from that terminal state via the mapping below — not from `captured_request.kind`. Only when `request_snapshot.status == "pending"` or `request_snapshot is None` (tombstone race) does the finalizer fall through to the existing kind-based escalation logic.

**Request-to-job terminal mapping:**

| `request_snapshot.status` | `turn_result.status` | `final_status` |
|---|---|---|
| `"resolved"` | `"completed"` | `"completed"` |
| `"resolved"` | `"interrupted"` or `"failed"` | `"unknown"` |
| `"canceled"` | any (typically `"interrupted"`) | `"canceled"` |
| `"pending"` OR request record is `None` | any | fall through to existing kind-based logic |

Rationale per row:

- `resolved + completed` → `completed`. The operator's decision was accepted, the worker dispatched the respond payload, App Server processed the turn normally, and the turn closed cleanly. Happy path.
- `resolved + non-completed` → `unknown` (OB-1). The operator's decision was accepted and dispatched, but something interrupted the turn after dispatch. Because the plugin cannot verify whether App Server applied the decision before the interrupt, the honest terminal state is `unknown`. Covers rare cases where a post-dispatch abort or transport fault interferes with the turn's natural completion.
- `canceled + any` → `canceled`. The request was canceled on the worker path (timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded is the only path under Packet 1 that reaches `_finalize_turn` with `request.status="canceled"`; every other cancel-writing path terminalizes via `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal` — see the path table below). Matching `DelegationJob.status` is `"canceled"` per §JobStatus='canceled' propagation.
- `pending` OR `None` → fall through. Under Packet 1 this should not occur (every capture path writes a terminal request status before the finalizer runs), but the fallback preserves the pre-Packet-1 kind-based escalation semantics as defense-in-depth. A log warning is emitted when this branch fires so the anomaly is observable.

**Why `request_snapshot` reads the store, not `captured_request`.** `captured_request` is the struct that `_execute_live_turn` passed into `_finalize_turn` — captured at parking time, before the worker's terminal writes. Its `status` field still reads `pending`. The authoritative signal lives on the store record that the worker mutated via `mark_resolved` or `record_timeout`. The `request_snapshot = pending_request_store.get(captured_request.request_id)` call is the direct check of "is this request still in-flight?" and is symmetric with the tombstone guard inside `_project_pending_escalation` (which also reads the store's `request.status` rather than trusting struct fields passed in by the caller). The one-snapshot invariant (above) then ensures this single store read is the sole authority for final-status derivation — no second `pending_request_store.get(...).status` may participate.

**D4 blind-write suppression (single-snapshot form).** The existing D4 carve-out at `delegation_controller.py:1467-1470` unconditionally calls `self._pending_request_store.update_status(captured_request.request_id, "resolved")` before status derivation. Under Packet 1, this would overwrite the worker's `"canceled"` write (from `record_timeout` on the timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded path) with `"resolved"`, breaking the atomicity the `record_timeout` mutator contract guarantees and corrupting the analytics split between resolved-and-canceled outcomes on that path.

Under the one-snapshot rule, the D4 decision reads `request_snapshot.status` (never a fresh `get`):

| `request_snapshot.status` | D4 action | Terminal-guard decision |
|---|---|---|
| `"resolved"` or `"canceled"` | **Skip D4** — worker already wrote terminal state; a D4 write would either be redundant (`resolved`) or corrupt the worker's terminal write (`canceled`). | Map via Request-to-job terminal mapping table above. |
| `"pending"` | D4 **may** write `update_status(request_id, "resolved")` for legacy fall-through semantics. **Final-status derivation still treats the authoritative status as the pre-D4 `"pending"` snapshot** and falls through to kind-based logic — the D4 write does not retroactively promote the snapshot. | Fall through to kind-based logic (existing `if captured_request.kind in _CANCEL_CAPABLE_KINDS` branch). |
| `None` (tombstone race) | **Skip D4** — no record to promote. Log the anomaly. | Fall through to kind-based logic. |

The critical property: the snapshot is frozen at the first read. Any D4 mutation that follows is visible to future store reads but invisible to the captured snapshot, so the terminal-guard decision derives from the pre-D4 observation. This is why the invariant is "one snapshot governs," not "two reads agree."

**Which paths hit the finalizer, which bypass it:**

| Worker path | Request terminal state before finalizer | Reaches `_finalize_turn`? | Guard resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| Decide-success (any kind) | `resolved` | **Yes** — happy path observes `turn/completed` naturally and collects `protocol_echo` | Maps to `completed` (or `unknown` on rare post-dispatch turn faults) |
| Timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded (cancel-capable kinds) | `canceled` | **Yes** — worker returns `None`, `_run_turn` continues to `turn/completed(interrupted)` | Maps to `canceled` |
| Timeout-interrupt-succeeded (non-cancel-capable kind) | `canceled` | **No** — sentinel bypass via `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="timeout_interrupt_succeeded")` | N/A |
| Timeout-interrupt-failed (non-cancel-capable kind) | `canceled` | **No** — sentinel bypass via `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="timeout_interrupt_failed")` | N/A |
| Timeout-cancel-dispatch-failed (cancel-capable kinds) | `canceled` | **No** — sentinel bypass via `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed")` | N/A |
| Dispatch-failed (any kind) | `canceled` | **No** — sentinel bypass via `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="dispatch_failed")` | N/A |
| Internal-abort | `canceled` | **No** — sentinel bypass via `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="internal_abort")` | N/A |
| Unknown-kind parse failure | request is `pending` per audit-trail contract (see §Unknown-kind contract) | **Yes** — `captured_request_parse_failed=True` | Guard falls through; existing `interrupted_by_unknown` branch routes to `final_status="unknown"` |
| No capture (analytical turn) | `captured_request=None` | **Yes** — captured-request branch skipped entirely | Existing `turn_result.status` mapping applies |

The guard is only load-bearing for the two **Yes** rows with a terminal request: decide-success and timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded. All five sentinel-bypass rows terminalize the job and close the session before raising, so they never reach `_finalize_turn`. The unknown-kind and no-capture rows pass through the guard without firing the terminal-state mapping.

**Why sentinel-bypass is not viable for the guarded paths.** Decide-success needs the natural `turn/completed` notification to collect `protocol_echo` signals (`_verify_post_turn_signals` at `spec:988-989`, `record_protocol_echo` at `spec:989`). Bypassing `_finalize_turn` would skip these post-turn observations. Timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded could theoretically use a sentinel, but the symmetric finalizer-guard handling is simpler: both post-resolution paths run the same finalizer logic and terminate with the correct `DelegationJob.status`. The sentinel-bypass branches are reserved for paths where the session is torn down before `turn/completed` and there is no value in waiting for it.

**Callsite change summary (additions to the §Unknown-kind contract Callsite change summary above):**

- `delegation_controller.py:1467-1478` — restructure the captured-request branch around a single snapshot read at the top:

  ```python
  request_snapshot = self._pending_request_store.get(
      captured_request.request_id
  )
  ```

  Consume this snapshot (not any fresh re-read) for three decisions, in order:

  1. **D4 write** (replaces the unconditional D4 at `:1467-1470`): only write `update_status(request_id, "resolved")` when `request_snapshot.status == "pending"`. Skip when `request_snapshot.status in ("resolved", "canceled")` or `request_snapshot is None`.
  2. **Terminal-guard mapping** (replaces the kind-based check at `:1473-1478`): when `request_snapshot.status in ("resolved", "canceled")`, set `final_status` per the Request-to-job terminal mapping table above and skip the existing kind-based escalation branch entirely.
  3. **Fall-through** (preserves existing semantics): when `request_snapshot.status == "pending"` or `request_snapshot is None`, proceed to the kind-based logic (`if captured_request.kind in _CANCEL_CAPABLE_KINDS` per the Unknown-kind contract's Callsite change summary). For the `None` case, emit a log warning noting the anomalous tombstone state.

  Any later reads within the finalizer are permitted **only** for return-shape hydration (non-status fields — `resolved_at`, `dispatch_result`, `protocol_echo_*`) and must not feed the terminal-guard decision. This is the one-snapshot invariant stated above; future maintainers must not introduce a second `pending_request_store.get(captured_request.request_id)` whose `.status` re-enters the derivation.

  This change is compatible with — and sits strictly above — the R12 `interrupted_by_unknown` routing to `final_status="unknown"`: an unknown-kind parse-failure path persists the audit request as `pending`, so the terminal guard does not fire (snapshot is `pending`) and the existing unknown-kind branch still applies via fall-through.

**Tests to add:**

- Decide-success terminal guard (happy path): arrange `decide(approve)` on a `command_approval` request; let the worker run the full success sequence (`mark_resolved`, `update_parked_request(None)`, `registry.discard`, handler returns `None`); stage `turn/completed(status="completed")`; verify `_finalize_turn` reads the request once into `request_snapshot`, observes `request_snapshot.status="resolved"`, and sets `final_status="completed"` (not `"needs_escalation"`); verify `poll()` returns `job.status="completed"`; verify NO escalation audit event was written post-decide.
- Timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded terminal guard: arrange a `file_change` request that times out; worker calls `session.respond({"decision": "cancel"})` successfully, then `record_timeout(..., dispatch_result="succeeded")`; stage `turn/completed(status="interrupted")`; verify `_finalize_turn` reads the request once into `request_snapshot`, observes `request_snapshot.status="canceled"`, and sets `final_status="canceled"` (not `"needs_escalation"`); verify `poll()` returns `job.status="canceled"`; verify `_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed` emits `DelegationOutcomeRecord` with `terminal_status="canceled"`.
- D4 blind-write suppression (snapshot-terminal case): arrange a timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded path (as above); before `_finalize_turn`'s captured-request branch, verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid).status == "canceled"`; after `_finalize_turn` returns, verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid).status` is still `"canceled"` (NOT overwritten to `"resolved"`); confirm by inspecting the store's journal that no `update_status(rid, "resolved")` record was written in the finalizer window.
- One-snapshot invariant enforcement: instrument `PendingRequestStore.get(request_id=<rid>)` with a call counter during `_finalize_turn`; run any of the captured-request paths (decide-success, timeout-cancel-dispatch-succeeded, anomalous pending); assert the counter for that `rid` increments **exactly once** from within the captured-request branch for the purpose of status derivation (hydration reads for non-status fields are permitted only if they use a distinct access pattern that the test harness recognizes as non-derivation). This test protects the one-snapshot invariant against future regressions that might reintroduce a `.status` re-read between D4 and the terminal guard.
- Post-dispatch turn fault (OB-1 fallback): arrange decide-success followed by `turn/completed(status="failed")` (simulates a post-dispatch fault in App Server); verify `_finalize_turn` reads `request_snapshot` once, observes `request_snapshot.status="resolved"` + `turn_result.status="failed"`, and sets `final_status="unknown"` (OB-1: transport applied the decision but turn-level outcome is unverified); verify `poll()` returns `job.status="unknown"`.
- Anomalous captured+pending fallback (one-snapshot semantics): construct a synthetic trace where `captured_request` is non-None and not parse-failed, but `pending_request_store.get(request_id).status == "pending"` at finalizer entry (should not happen under Packet 1, but defends against future changes); verify `_finalize_turn` reads `request_snapshot` once, observes `request_snapshot.status="pending"`, writes D4 `update_status(rid, "resolved")` as legacy fall-through behavior, and **still** falls through to the existing kind-based escalation logic based on the pre-D4 `request_snapshot.status="pending"` (NOT a post-D4 re-read that would see `"resolved"`); verify the kind-based branch then produces `final_status="needs_escalation"` for `captured_request.kind in _CANCEL_CAPABLE_KINDS` without raising; verify a log warning is emitted noting the anomalous state; verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid).status == "resolved"` after `_finalize_turn` returns (D4 wrote through), confirming the derivation and the D4 side effect are on different authorities.

### Rejection reasons (unchanged)

`DecisionRejectedReason` at `models.py:37-47` already covers every Packet 1 case:

| Condition | Reason |
|---|---|
| `decide()` called twice for the same `request_id` (second CAS fails) | `request_already_decided` |
| `decide()` called when `job.status != "needs_escalation"` (post-wake `running`, terminal `completed` / `failed` / `canceled` / `unknown`, or cold-start orphan demotion) | `job_not_awaiting_decision` |
| Stale `request_id` | `request_not_found` |
| Ambiguous job↔request mapping | `request_job_mismatch` |

No additions needed.

### poll() — unchanged shape

`DelegationPollResult` retains its current fields. Post-dispatch observations reach the caller via:
- `job.status` transitions (`needs_escalation → running → completed | failed | canceled | unknown`). `canceled` is reached via **either** (a) the non-cancel timeout interrupt-succeeded branch (via `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="timeout_interrupt_succeeded")`), or (b) cancel-capable timeout with successful cancel dispatch (mapped by the §`_finalize_turn` Captured-Request Terminal Guard) — see §JobStatus='canceled' propagation. Both origins are verified-cancel terminal states, distinct from `unknown` which is the unverified-failure terminal state.
- `PendingEscalationView` (updated for the current parked request, if any)
- Later inspection surfaces for `PendingServerRequest.dispatch_result`, `resolved_at`, `protocol_echo_*` (not added to `PendingEscalationView` — see §Observability)

### The consuming window — honest poll semantics

Between `decide()`'s return and the worker's `job_store._persist_job_transition("running")` call, there is a transient window where `poll()` can legitimately observe:

- `job.status == "needs_escalation"` (worker has not yet transitioned)
- `job.parked_request_id == <rid>` (not yet cleared)
- `_project_pending_escalation` returning a `PendingEscalationView` for the decided request

This is NOT a bug and is NOT eliminated by any achievable synchronization short of blocking `decide()` until the worker wakes — which would recreate the synchronous-return failure that motivates Packet 1. Packet 1 accepts the window and documents it honestly.

**Properties of the consuming window:**

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Opens when | `decide()` returns `decision_accepted=True` |
| Closes when | Worker completes `job_store._persist_job_transition("running")` |
| Typical duration | Microseconds to low milliseconds — bounded by worker wake + one store write |
| What `poll()` shows inside the window | Same `PendingEscalationView` as before `decide()` returned |
| Risk | Caller that immediately polls after `decide()` may re-render the "awaiting approval" UI briefly, or (worse) call `decide()` again — the second call would return `request_already_decided` via the reservation CAS, which is safe but observable |
| Mitigation on caller side | Trust `decide()`'s `decision_accepted=True` as the authoritative "operator answer received"; use `poll()` for eventual state, not immediate re-verification |

**What the caller SHOULD do in the consuming window:** treat `decide()`'s successful return as the authoritative record that the decision has been accepted for dispatch. If the UI needs to reflect "decision accepted, dispatch pending," derive that state locally from the fact that `decide()` returned `decision_accepted=True`, not from an immediate `poll()`. Once the caller polls again (milliseconds later, or on the next user-driven poll), the window has closed and `job.status == "running"` or later.

**What the caller MUST NOT do:** assume that `poll()` immediately after `decide()` reflects the post-dispatch state. The spec's four-tier observability taxonomy (see §Observability) applies: transport-write outcome comes via store fields written post-dispatch; turn-terminal status comes via `job.status`; both trail `decide()`'s return by a bounded but nonzero delay.

**Honesty about alternatives (rejected):**

- *Block `decide()` until worker wakes.* Rejected — recreates the failure mode Packet 1 exists to fix. The whole point is that `decide()` returns while the worker proceeds asynchronously.
- *Have `decide()` write `status="running"` before returning.* Rejected — it would be honest about the registry state (reservation committed) but dishonest about the worker's progress (nothing has been dispatched yet). Worse, if the worker then fails, the job's recorded status lies about the sequence of events.
- *Add a `status="consuming"` intermediate JobStatus literal.* Rejected for Packet 1 scope — adds a new enum value for a window the caller can derive from `decide()`'s return anyway. Reconsider if downstream consumers turn out to need explicit persistence of this state.

### Projection helper rewrites (`_project_request_to_view` and `_project_pending_escalation`)

Packet 1 modifies both projection helpers at `delegation_controller.py:849-868`. The `EscalatableRequestKind` runtime guard lives at the **constructor** boundary (`_project_request_to_view`), not only at the polling boundary (`_project_pending_escalation`). Placing the guard at the constructor catches the Packet 1 projection callsites — `_project_pending_escalation` serves both `poll()` and `start()`'s escalation-return branch — and, by construction, any future caller that goes through `_project_request_to_view`. (`decide()` in Packet 1 returns the new 3-field `DelegationDecisionResult` and has no projection callsite to guard; the constructor-level guard is the mechanism by which any re-introduced projection in a later packet inherits the check without caller diligence.)

`_project_pending_escalation` is a **pure projection helper** in Packet 1: it re-raises `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` to its callers and never calls `signal_internal_abort` itself. Each callsite owns its own catch-and-signal semantics with a callsite-appropriate reason (`poll()` → `"unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection"`; `start()`'s escalation-return branch → `"parked_projection_invariant_violation"`, collapsing raised-exception and null-return into a single broad reason). Helper purity means a future packet that adds a new projection callsite can choose its own reason without the helper pre-committing one — the coordination primitive (`signal_internal_abort`) is callable from any callsite; the reason text is callsite-local.

**`_project_request_to_view` rewrite (constructor with runtime guard):**

```python
_ESCALATABLE_REQUEST_KINDS: frozenset[str] = frozenset(
    {"command_approval", "file_change", "request_user_input"}
)


def _project_request_to_view(
    self, request: PendingServerRequest
) -> PendingEscalationView:
    """Project a PendingServerRequest to the caller-visible PendingEscalationView.

    Raises UnknownKindInEscalationProjection if request.kind is not in the
    escalatable set. Under Packet 1 the caller control flow should prevent
    this (unknown-kind requests terminalize the job before reaching any
    projection callsite). The runtime guard is a belt-and-suspenders check
    against dynamic construction paths — e.g., a PendingServerRequest read
    from JSONL replay whose kind was persisted before the Packet 1 behavior
    change landed, or future callsites that bypass the type system.
    """
    if request.kind not in _ESCALATABLE_REQUEST_KINDS:
        raise UnknownKindInEscalationProjection(
            f"EscalatableRequestKind violation: request_id={request.request_id!r} "
            f"kind={request.kind!r:.100}. Under Packet 1, kind='unknown' "
            f"must never reach escalation projection; such jobs are "
            f"terminalized via the Unknown-kind contract."
        )
    # The narrow cast below is justified by the guard above. Static
    # type-checkers see cast(EscalatableRequestKind, request.kind).
    return PendingEscalationView(
        request_id=request.request_id,
        kind=cast(EscalatableRequestKind, request.kind),
        requested_scope=request.requested_scope,
        available_decisions=self._PLUGIN_DECISIONS,
    )
```

`UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` is a new exception type added in Packet 1. It is an internal assertion signal, not a caller-visible error — it MUST NOT escape the controller boundary. If raised, the callsite catches it, logs a critical error, routes cleanup through the **worker-coordinated internal-abort primitive** (see §Internal abort coordination), and returns a response consistent with the caller's current observation window. Main thread MUST NOT invoke `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` directly — that helper closes the worker-owned session and writes worker-owned store records, violating IO-1 and IO-3.

Implementation details per callsite:

- **`poll()` callsite:** wraps `_project_pending_escalation(job)` in `try/except UnknownKindInEscalationProjection`. **A `None` return from the helper is a legitimate no-view result** (terminal job guard, `parked_request_id is None`, tombstone guard) and does NOT trigger abort signaling — only a caught `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` signals. On catch: log at critical level with `job_id` and `request_id`, call `self._registry.signal_internal_abort(request_id, reason="unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection")`, proceed with `pending_escalation=None` in the poll result (the escalation was never legitimately constructible); subsequent polls observe the terminal `status="unknown"` after the worker's abort-path writes land. The helper itself is pure — poll() owns the signaling reason so that a future packet that adds a new projection callsite (e.g., an amendment-admission view) can choose its own reason without the helper pre-committing one.

    ```python
    # poll() projection-handling segment (parallel to start()'s Parked-arm wrapper):
    try:
        escalation_view = self._project_pending_escalation(job)
    except UnknownKindInEscalationProjection as exc:
        logger.critical(
            "delegation.poll: unknown-kind in escalation projection; "
            "signaling worker-coordinated internal abort",
            extra={
                "job_id": job.job_id,
                "request_id": job.parked_request_id,       # non-None here: the exception
                                                            # implies the helper's pre-checks
                                                            # passed (pending request exists)
                "cause": str(exc),
            },
        )
        self._registry.signal_internal_abort(
            job.parked_request_id,
            reason="unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection",
        )
        escalation_view = None
    # escalation_view is None in BOTH the legitimate-no-view case (no signal fired) and the
    # caught-exception case (signal already fired above). The caller sees pending_escalation=None
    # uniformly; the durable distinction between the two paths lives on the
    # PendingServerRequest.internal_abort_reason field (set only by the worker's subsequent
    # record_internal_abort write on the exception path).
    ```
- **`decide()` path:** under the Packet 1 async contract (see §DelegationDecisionResult — new shape), `decide()` no longer projects a pending-escalation view into its return value — the new shape is `{decision_accepted, job_id, request_id}` and `poll()` is the sole observation surface. `decide()` therefore has no remaining `_project_request_to_view` callsite in its normal path. If an intermediate helper re-introduces projection (during implementation or future packets), it follows the same rule: catch `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection`, log, call `signal_internal_abort(request_id, reason="unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection")`, then fall through to a rejection (`request_already_decided` or a new `internal_invariant_violation` reason — the specific rejection shape is deferred to the packet that adds the callsite). `decide()` itself in Packet 1 does not need this guard, but the exception-type is spec'd so future callsites cannot bypass it.

**What the caller observes.** The observation sequence depends on which operation wins the CAS at the registry entry when `poll()` issues `signal_internal_abort` on a caught `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` (the helper is pure; poll() owns the signaling — see §Projection helper rewrites):

**Branch A — `signal_internal_abort` wins the CAS (`awaiting → aborted`, returns `True`):**

1. Poll #1 (the thread that triggered projection) returns `DelegationPollResult(job=<current-snapshot>, pending_escalation=None, inspection=None, detail=None)`. The `job.status` may still read `needs_escalation` at this exact observation — the worker has not yet processed the abort signal. The caller sees "no actionable escalation surface," which is the honest reflection of the current snapshot.
2. The worker wakes on `InternalAbort(reason)`, executes the abort sequence (see §Internal abort coordination), and terminalizes the job as `unknown`.
3. Poll #2 (any subsequent poll) sees `job.status="unknown"`, `pending_escalation=None`. A concurrent `decide()` against this `request_id` is rejected: `request_already_decided` while the registry entry is still live (aborted), then `job_not_awaiting_decision` once the worker's abort-path writes land and advance `job.status` off `needs_escalation`.

**Branch B — `decide()` wins the CAS (`signal_internal_abort` returns `False`):**

1. Poll #1 returns the same `pending_escalation=None` snapshot as Branch A step 1. The projection failed on the poll thread and the observation is not retroactively invalidated, even though the abort signal lost the race.
2. The operator's reservation committed before the abort signal arrived. The worker wakes on the operator's `DecisionResolution` and completes dispatch via the normal success path or the dispatch-failure path. The abort attempt's only artifact is a log line recording the `False` return from `signal_internal_abort`.
3. Subsequent polls reflect the operator's decided outcome — `status="running"` while dispatch is in flight, then terminal `DelegationJob.status="completed"` on dispatch success or `DelegationJob.status="unknown"` on dispatch failure. (The paragraph above is about `DelegationJob.status` transitions observed via `poll()`. `resolved` is a `PendingServerRequest.status` literal — a different layer — and does NOT appear on `DelegationJob.status`.) No abort-origin record is written on this branch.

Both branches are eventually consistent: the window where `status="needs_escalation"` and `pending_escalation=None` are both observed is bounded by the worker's wake-to-cleanup latency (a single-threaded sequence with no I/O beyond JSONL appends). Callers that poll repeatedly see the state settle.

**Rejection literals (two guards, two reasons).** A late `decide()` is rejected by one of two guards, depending on how far the worker has advanced the job state:

- **Live registry window → `request_already_decided`.** While the job is still `needs_escalation` but the registry entry has already left `awaiting` (via operator `decide()`, `signal_internal_abort`, or the registry's timeout timer), `registry.reserve()` returns `None` and the controller rejects with `request_already_decided`. The request slot is no longer addressable on the registry side.
- **Post-wake window → `job_not_awaiting_decision`.** Once the worker has processed the wake outcome, it advances the job's status off `needs_escalation` — to `running` for accepted decides and cancel-capable timeouts, and to a terminal state (`completed` / `canceled` / `unknown`) once dispatch completes or an abort/dispatch-failure writes its completion record. (Terminal literals here are `DelegationJob.status` values, not `PendingRequestStatus`; `resolved` lives on the request layer and never appears on `DelegationJob.status`.) From that point the job-status guard at `delegation_controller.py:1577` rejects with `job_not_awaiting_decision` before `decide()` even reaches the registry.

Packet 1 does not introduce a new `request_already_aborted` reason — the two existing reasons cover both guards honestly. The durable distinction between the underlying wake outcomes lives in the `PendingServerRequest` terminal-circumstance fields: `resolution_action` for operator decides, `timed_out=True` for timer, `internal_abort_reason` for internal aborts. Audit queries join on those fields, not on the rejection literal.

**`_project_pending_escalation` rewrite (job-anchored, tombstone-guarded):**

Current implementation at `delegation_controller.py:860-868` uses `requests[-1]` (last record). Replace with job-anchored + tombstone-guarded logic:

```python
def _project_pending_escalation(
    self, job: DelegationJob,
) -> PendingEscalationView | None:
    """Project a job's parked request into a view. PURE — no side effects.

    Returns None for legitimate no-view states (terminal, unparked, tombstone).
    Re-raises UnknownKindInEscalationProjection for invariant violations so
    each callsite owns its own abort-signaling and rejection semantics. The
    helper never calls signal_internal_abort and never logs critical errors;
    those concerns live at callsites (poll(), start()'s escalation-return
    branch) because the appropriate reason and caller-facing response differ
    between them.

        return None                                           # tombstone guard: req resolved
                                                              # but job field not yet cleared
    return self._project_request_to_view(request)             # may raise
                                                              # UnknownKindInEscalationProjection
```

The helper is **job-anchored** (takes `DelegationJob`), not collaboration-anchored — the authority chain starts at `poll(job_id)` at `:901-902`. Callers update to pass the job object.

### contracts.md updates

Packet 1 touches five sections of `contracts.md`. The update set is load-bearing for ticket AC4 ("Spec names every public contract change").

**§decide (`contracts.md:297-310`):** rewrite to reflect:
- Async model (decide returns before dispatch completes)
- Minimal response payload (`decision_accepted`, `job_id`, `request_id`)
- poll as sole observation surface for post-decide state
- "Accepted for dispatch" verb, not "applied"

**§Start (locate the `codex.delegate.start` section in `contracts.md`):** document the existing success union explicitly. Packet 1 does NOT introduce a new wrapper, but the previously-implicit cases surface new JSON shapes at the MCP boundary:

| Internal outcome | Return type | MCP JSON shape | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parked (parkable capture) | `DelegationEscalation` | `{"job": {...}, "pending_escalation": {...}, "agent_context": "...", "escalated": true}` | Existing shape; unchanged. |
| Turn completed without capture | plain `DelegationJob` | `{"job_id": "...", "status": "completed", ...}` | No `pending_escalation` key; no `escalated: true` marker. |
| Unknown-kind parse failure | plain `DelegationJob` | `{"job_id": "...", "status": "unknown", ...}` | No `pending_escalation` key; no `escalated: true` marker; no new `outcome` field. |
| Start-wait budget elapsed | plain `DelegationJob` | `{"job_id": "...", "status": "running", ...}` | No `pending_escalation` key; no `escalated: true` marker. Synchronous handshake budget elapsed without a terminal outcome signal; caller polls for eventual outcome. NOT a worker failure (see `StartWaitElapsed` in §Capture-ready handshake). |
| Worker exception (pre-capture) | N/A — raises | MCP tool error (`DelegationStartError`, `reason="worker_failed_before_capture"`) | Not a successful response body. |
| Parked projection invariant violation | N/A — raises | MCP tool error (`DelegationStartError`, `reason="parked_projection_invariant_violation"`) | Plugin-side invariant mismatch after `Parked` signal; worker owns async cleanup via `signal_internal_abort` (see §Internal abort coordination). Not a successful response body. |

The MCP serializer at `mcp_server.py:443-450` requires no change: the existing `isinstance(result, DelegationEscalation)` branch handles the parked case; the `asdict(result)` fallthrough handles all plain-`DelegationJob` cases (`status ∈ {completed, unknown, running}`). The MCP JSON-shape tests must cover each of the three status values — the `running` case is the one Packet 1 newly exercises.

**§Pending Escalation View (`contracts.md:325-334`):** tighten the `kind` enum from four literals to three: `command_approval`, `file_change`, `request_user_input`. Add a note: "`unknown` is a valid `PendingRequestKind` at the store/audit layer but cannot appear in a `PendingEscalationView` under Packet 1 — such requests terminalize the job instead (see §Unknown-kind contract in the design spec)."

**§DelegationJob.status and §active_delegation.status (`contracts.md:73` and `contracts.md:379`):** expand the `status` enum from 6 literals to 7 by adding `"canceled"` at both sites. Copy the literal list: `queued`, `running`, `needs_escalation`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`, `unknown`. Add a definitional note on `canceled`: "terminal state reached via the non-cancel timeout interrupt-succeeded branch OR the cancel-capable timeout with successful cancel-dispatch; distinct from `unknown` (which indicates unverified transport failure). See §JobStatus='canceled' propagation in the design spec." This is a real public-contract expansion — the delegate skill's status-routing table and any consumer that enumerates the status set must admit the new literal. Migration guidance: pre-Packet-1 JSONL records have no `canceled` entries (no historical data anomalies); post-Packet-1 runtime-generated records may carry the new literal.

**§discard (locate the `codex.delegate.discard` section in `contracts.md`):** expand the admissibility rule to admit `status="canceled"` with null `promotion_state`, alongside the existing `failed`/`unknown` branch. Updated rule text: "Discardable when `promotion_state in ("pending", "prechecks_failed")` OR when `status in ("failed", "unknown", "canceled")` with null `promotion_state`. Post-mutation states (`applied`, `rollback_needed`) remain non-discardable regardless of status." Rationale: the `list_user_attention_required` surface includes canceled jobs under §JobStatus='canceled' propagation; the discard contract must offer the matching close path or the "retry-or-dismiss" UX promise is unbacked. The corresponding controller change is in the §JobStatus='canceled' propagation table row for `delegation_controller.py:1404-1406`. Migration guidance: existing discard callers observing `DiscardRejectedResponse(reason="job_not_discardable")` on a canceled job may now see `DiscardResult` instead; no caller relied on the rejection as a signal (canceled never reached discardability under pre-Packet-1 semantics — it was not a valid job status at all), so this is a strict behavior widening without regression risk.

### MCP tool schema (no JSON-schema change) and custom serializer

`mcp_server.py` declares `inputSchema` only for tools; there is no `outputSchema`. Output contracts live in the Python return types plus a thin serialization layer.

**Important correction from an earlier draft:** the serialization path is **not** simply "dataclass → `asdict` automatic." At `mcp_server.py:505-516` there is a custom `DelegationDecisionResult` branch that explicitly reads `result.job`, `result.decision`, `result.resumed`, `result.pending_escalation`, and `result.agent_context` — all five fields the new dataclass removes. Changing only the dataclass would raise `AttributeError` on every `codex.delegate.decide` MCP call. That branch must be updated as part of this packet.

Preferred remediation: simplify the branch to the fallthrough shape used by other tools:

```python
# Current (at mcp_server.py:505-516) — reads removed fields; MUST change
if isinstance(result, DelegationDecisionResult):
    payload = {
        "job": asdict(result.job),
        "decision": result.decision,
        "resumed": result.resumed,
    }
    if result.pending_escalation is not None:
        payload["pending_escalation"] = asdict(result.pending_escalation)
    if result.agent_context is not None:
        payload["agent_context"] = result.agent_context
    return payload
return asdict(result)

# Replacement — falls through to the existing else-branch pattern
return asdict(result)   # {"decision_accepted": bool, "job_id": str, "request_id": str}
```

Breaking changes therefore live in:

- `DelegationDecisionResult` definition (`models.py:418-426`)
- `delegation_controller.decide()` (returns new shape)
- `mcp_server.py:505-516` (custom serializer branch — remove or replace as above)
- `contracts.md` §decide
- Integration/model tests that assert on `decision`, `resumed`, `pending_escalation` (e.g., `test_mcp_server.py:1202`)

Any tests that inspect the MCP response shape (as opposed to the raw dataclass) must also be updated — the surface is now a 3-field object, not a nested job/pending_escalation structure.

## Observability and Honesty Rules

### Four-tier observation taxonomy

| Tier | Signal | Observed when | What we can claim | What we cannot claim |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Transport write** | `respond()` returned vs. `BrokenPipeError` | Synchronous with worker's respond() call | "Plugin wrote response JSON to App Server stdin"; "Local stdin flush completed (buffered bytes were handed to the OS pipe)" | "Fsync completed" (pipes have no backing store to fsync); "App Server received"; "Decision applied" |
| **Protocol echo** | `serverRequest/resolved` matching `requestId` OR `item/completed` matching `item_id` | Async, post-respond, request-scoped (current warning-only code at `delegation_controller.py:2079-2108`) | `serverRequest/resolved`: "App Server resolved or cleared the pending request at the protocol layer" (per `docs/codex-app-server.md:987, 1004` this fires both on our response AND on lifecycle cleanup — turn start/complete/interrupt). `item/completed`: "The corresponding item reached protocol-terminal state (`completed`/`failed`/`declined`)" | "App Server processed our specific response" (the signal does not distinguish response-driven resolution from lifecycle-cleanup-driven resolution); "The targeted operation was executed"; "The decision was honored" |
| **Turn terminal** | `turn/completed` / `interrupted` / `failed` | Async, turn-scoped | "Turn reached terminal state X after our dispatch" | "Terminal state reflects the dispatch" |
| **Subsequent capture** | Another server-request notification | Async, turn-scoped | "App Server continued running and emitted a new request" | "The new request results from the prior decision" |

### Observation channels

**Transport-write outcome** — persisted on `PendingServerRequest.dispatch_result`. Written immediately after `respond()` returns or raises. Record survives even on failure (for audit).

**Protocol echo** — persisted on `PendingServerRequest.protocol_echo_signals` and `protocol_echo_observed_at`. Promoted from the current warning-only `_verify_post_turn_signals` helper at `delegation_controller.py:2079-2108`. The refactored helper returns observed signals; the worker persists them via `record_protocol_echo`.

**Turn terminal** — already persisted via `job.status` transition and `DelegationOutcomeRecord` emission at `_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed` (`delegation_controller.py:801`). No new audit channel needed.

**Subsequent capture** — implicit in the notification loop's continued operation. No new durable record; each subsequent capture creates its own `PendingServerRequest` record per existing flow.

### What is never added

Per OB-1:

- No "decision applied" field anywhere.
- No "resolution accepted by App Server" observation.
- No heuristic inference ("dispatch succeeded AND continuation observed within N seconds → probably applied") in plugin records. Such inferences belong in analytics tools that consume the audit trail, not in the plugin's durable state.

### Sanitization rules for error-string fields

`PendingServerRequest` carries three forensic string fields: `dispatch_error` (set when `dispatch_result="failed"`), `interrupt_error` (set on the non-cancel-capable timeout path when `session.interrupt_turn` raises), and `internal_abort_reason` (set by the internal-abort worker wake branch). None of these fields is a log sink. All three are bounded, sanitized summaries suitable for long-lived persistence in JSONL records that may be replayed across plugin versions.

**Format:**

```
"<ExceptionClassName>: <message>"
```

- `ExceptionClassName` is the exception's `type(exc).__name__` (e.g., `RuntimeError`, `BrokenPipeError`).
- `message` is `str(exc)` truncated to **200 characters**, with trailing `...` elision if truncation occurred. Newlines and control characters are replaced with `\n` / `\t` / escaped Unicode so the stored string is always a single JSONL-safe line.
- No traceback. No `exc.__dict__`. No `exc.args` dump. No payload fragments.
- For `internal_abort_reason` specifically, the `reason` argument is already a short identifier-style string chosen from a controlled vocabulary (`"parked_projection_invariant_violation"`, `"unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection"`, and future additions from this design). The sanitizer still applies — truncate at 200 characters and strip control characters — as a belt-and-suspenders guard against callers who pass free-form text.

**Combined cap:** 256 characters per field, including the class-name prefix. Any field value longer than 256 characters after the rules above is a coding bug (a too-long class name); the sanitizer truncates and logs a warning.

**Why bounded and sanitized.** These fields land in JSONL records read by replay on every plugin startup. Unbounded error strings risk (a) memory / disk bloat from degenerate error messages, (b) JSONL line corruption from embedded control characters, (c) accidental leakage of captured payload data into long-lived forensic state. Bounding also makes grep/audit queries over the field practical: operators looking for a specific failure class can match on the prefix without unbounded scan costs.

**Why not more.** A full traceback is a log-time convenience, not a forensic artifact; it belongs in the process log stream, not in the durable store. An operator investigating a failure reads the log stream for the traceback and cross-references via the store's `request_id` / `job_id`. The store field answers "what class of failure was this" for aggregate analytics; the log answers "exactly where in code did it happen" for one-off triage.

### Timeout audit event

Free-form audit event via `journal.append_audit_event`:

```python
AuditEvent(
    event_id=uuid(),
    timestamp=now_iso(),
    actor="system",
    action="approval_timeout",
    collaboration_id=job.collaboration_id,
    runtime_id=job.runtime_id,
    job_id=job.job_id,
    request_id=rid,
    ...
)
```

Narrative record of "registry timer fired for this request." Not recovery-critical; the `PendingServerRequest.timed_out=True` field is the durable fact. Audit event is for analytics / human review trails.

### `PendingEscalationView` stays field-minimal; `kind` narrows

`PendingEscalationView` at `models.py:441` retains its current "minimal caller-visible subset needed to render an escalation prompt" role. The new `PendingServerRequest` fields (`dispatch_result`, `resolved_at`, `protocol_echo_*`, `timed_out`) are diagnostic / historical state, not prompt-rendering state. Adding them would blur "current action needed" with "forensic request record."

Packet 1 does narrow one existing field: `PendingEscalationView.kind` retypes from `PendingRequestKind` (4 literals including `"unknown"`) to the new `EscalatableRequestKind` (3 literals excluding `"unknown"`). See §EscalatableRequestKind. This is strictly a narrowing — no field added, no field removed, no prompt-rendering semantics changed. It reflects the Packet 1 behavior that `kind="unknown"` never reaches an escalation.

A future inspection surface (not Packet 1) may expose the forensic fields.

## Recovery and Reconciliation

### Existing reconciliation (retained)

- **Orphan demotion** at `delegation_controller.py:2036-2038`: after cold restart, any job persisted as `running` or `needs_escalation` is demoted to `unknown` because the runtime subprocess that served it is gone.
- **Journal reconciliation** at `delegation_controller.py:1856-1884`: for each unresolved `approval_resolution` idempotency_key, writes `phase="completed"` to close the row.

### New (this spec)

- **Completion provenance annotation:** the recovery-written `phase="completed"` records at `:1870-1884` gain `completion_origin="recovered_unresolved"`. Worker-written completions gain `completion_origin="worker_completed"`. Old records without the field are interpreted as `None` (back-compat read).
- **Projection tombstone guard** (already specified in `_project_pending_escalation` §contracts): between the worker's `mark_resolved` and `update_parked_request(None)` writes, the job may transiently show `parked_request_id != None` while the request's `status == "resolved"`. Projection returns None in this window rather than surfacing a stale view.
- **Terminal-status projection guard** (already specified): jobs in `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`, or `unknown` status return None from projection regardless of `parked_request_id`. The field is dead state once the job is terminal; the projection ignores it. Recovery does not proactively clear the field — projection's read-path guard is sufficient.

### Recovery does not claim success

`completion_origin="recovered_unresolved"` is the durable honesty about crash-abandoned rows. Downstream consumers that interpreted `phase="completed"` as "operation succeeded" were already wrong (because the current code blind-closes rows even before this spec); the new field gives them a correct signal to distinguish.

### Journal validator relaxation (REQUIRED schema change)

The journal validator at `packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/server/journal.py:124-136` (intent) and `:137-157` (dispatched) currently enforces `isinstance(record.get("decision"), str)` — i.e., `decision` is required to be a non-None string for any `approval_resolution` record. Under the current codebase, every write passes `decision=DecisionAction` literal so this holds.

Packet 1 introduces `approval_resolution.intent` and `dispatched` records with `decision=None` on two non-operator wake paths — timeout wake and internal-abort wake (the `PendingServerRequest` fields `timed_out` and `internal_abort_reason` discriminate the two at the store layer). The validator must relax the `decision` check on those two branches to:

```python
elif op == "approval_resolution" and phase == "intent":
    ...  # job_id (string), request_id (string) still required
    decision = record.get("decision")
    if decision is not None and not isinstance(decision, str):
        raise SchemaViolation(
            "approval_resolution at intent requires decision to be a string or None"
        )

elif op == "approval_resolution" and phase == "dispatched":
    ...  # job_id, request_id, runtime_id, codex_thread_id (strings) still required
    decision = record.get("decision")
    if decision is not None and not isinstance(decision, str):
        raise SchemaViolation(
            "approval_resolution at dispatched requires decision to be a string or None"
        )
```

**Scope of the relaxation — narrow by intent:**

- `decision=None` is permitted on `approval_resolution.intent` and `.dispatched` ONLY — no other operation.
- `decision=None` semantically means "non-operator-origin resolution" (Packet 1: timeout-wake and internal-abort-wake; the `PendingServerRequest` fields `timed_out` vs. `internal_abort_reason` discriminate the two. Future packets may add other non-operator origins).
- `DecisionAction` at `models.py:34` stays `Literal["approve", "deny"]` — the operator-decision vocabulary is NOT widened. `decision=None` is a journal-level representation, not a new operator decision.
- Readers that interpret `decision` must handle None explicitly; treating it as a missing required field (as today) would reject valid records post-migration.

**Test updates:** existing `test_journal.py` assertions that `approval_resolution intent requires decision (string)` must be amended to allow None. Recovery code at `delegation_controller.py:1856-1884` must also accept None when reading journal intent records.

### What does NOT change

- Phase enum (`intent/dispatched/completed`) is untouched.
- Operation enum (`_VALID_OPERATIONS`) is untouched — `approval_resolution` already present; no new `approval_timeout` operation introduced.
- `_phase_rank` helper unchanged.
- `DecisionAction` literal at `models.py:34` stays `approve | deny`.

## Timeout Policy

### The operator window

**`APPROVAL_OPERATOR_WINDOW_SECONDS`** — local abandonment budget, configurable.

- **Default:** 900s (provisional). Marked for empirical refinement during implementation.
- **Framing:** local plugin-side tolerance for operator delay. **Not** a value derived from any repo-authoritative upstream contract. The Codex App Server's own server-request timeout is external and unknown to this codebase.
- **Configuration surface:** env var (or plugin settings file) for per-deployment override.

### Interaction with existing transport timeouts

The existing timeouts at `runtime.py:49` (client-side `request_timeout`, default 1200s) and `runtime.py:233` (notification-loop timeout, default 1200s) **do not directly bound** the operator window, because neither is active while the handler is parked:

- Client-side `request_timeout` governs OUR outbound requests (`turn/start`, `turn/interrupt`). Not used during the parked handler block.
- Notification-loop timeout governs inter-notification gaps during the turn. The loop is not calling `next_notification` during the parked block — it is inside `server_request_handler(notification)` at `runtime.py:246`. The timeout resets after each handler return.

The true coordination rule is: `operator_window < App_Server's_server_request_timeout` (external, unknown). The 900s default is conservative under the assumption that App Server mirrors the 1200s convention, but the spec makes no claim to repo-authoritative justification.

### Expiry mechanics

1. Registry timer fires after `APPROVAL_OPERATOR_WINDOW_SECONDS`.
2. Registry publishes a synthetic **timeout resolution** — same channel as a real `decide()` would use, but with an internal flag indicating origin.
3. Worker wakes (identical wake path to the real-decide path).
4. Worker handles the timeout kind-sensitively (see next section).

### Kind-sensitive timeout dispatch

Mirrors the existing capture-time kind distinctions at `delegation_controller.py:640-643, 698-720`:

| Request kind | Capture-time (current) | Timeout-time (new) |
|---|---|---|
| `command_approval` | `{"decision": "cancel"}` | `{"decision": "cancel"}` — dispatch via respond() |
| `file_change` | `{"decision": "cancel"}` | `{"decision": "cancel"}` — dispatch via respond() |
| `request_user_input` | `{"answers": {}}` (known-denial at `:720`) | `entry.session.interrupt_turn(...)` — no respond() |
| `unknown` | `interrupt_turn` (D4 carve-out at `:690-695`) | **N/A** — `kind="unknown"` never parks under Packet 1 (see §Unknown-kind contract), so no registry entry and no timer exist; there is no timeout path |

**Why narrowed for Packet 1:** `request_user_input`'s timeout-response contract is not pinned in the codex-app-server docs. The existing capture-time `{"answers": {}}` path is known to work as denial; using the same payload at timeout-time is plausible but uncertainty on App Server-side behavior argues for `interrupt_turn` instead. Packet 2 or a later packet may expand timeout automation to `request_user_input` after its response contract is explicitly confirmed.

### Timeout record fields

For cancel-capable kinds — dispatch-succeeded branch:

```
PendingServerRequest after cancel-dispatch (success):
  resolution_action: None                         # operator did not decide
  response_payload: {"decision": "cancel"}        # what was dispatched
  response_dispatch_at: "<iso>"                   # when respond() was called
  dispatch_result: "succeeded"                    # transport write returned
  dispatch_error: None                            # no error
  resolved_at: None                               # not resolved — timed out
  timed_out: True                                 # circumstance marker
  status: "canceled"                              # wire lifecycle
```

For cancel-capable kinds — dispatch-failed branch (see §Timeout path cancel-dispatch try/except):

```
PendingServerRequest after cancel-dispatch (failure):
  resolution_action: None                         # operator did not decide
  response_payload: {"decision": "cancel"}        # attempted payload (preserved for forensics)
  response_dispatch_at: "<iso>"                   # when respond() was called
  dispatch_result: "failed"                       # transport raised
  dispatch_error: "<ExceptionClass>: <bounded msg>"  # sanitized, bounded (see §Observability)
  resolved_at: None                               # not resolved — timed out and dispatch failed
  timed_out: True                                 # circumstance marker
  status: "canceled"                              # wire lifecycle
# Job status terminalizes to "unknown" (not "failed", per OB-1): plugin cannot
# verify whether App Server applied the cancel.
```

For non-cancel-capable kinds:

```
PendingServerRequest after timeout interrupt:
  resolution_action: None
  response_payload: None                          # no dispatch occurred
  response_dispatch_at: None
  dispatch_result: None
  dispatch_error: None
  resolved_at: None
  timed_out: True
  status: "canceled"
```

## Testing and Migration

### Testing strategy

**Unit tests (per new store mutator):**
- `PendingRequestStore.record_response_dispatch` — round-trip through append + replay
- `PendingRequestStore.mark_resolved` — status transition + timestamp set
- `PendingRequestStore.record_protocol_echo` — signals tuple + timestamp
- `PendingRequestStore.record_timeout` — timed_out flag + status=canceled atomicity; all four dispatch-field combinations (interrupted-path None-tuple, cancel-dispatch-succeeded, cancel-dispatch-failed-with-error, replay consistency on each)
- `PendingRequestStore.record_dispatch_failure` — single-append atomicity of {dispatch_result=failed, status=canceled, resolved_at=None, resolution_action, response_payload, response_dispatch_at, dispatch_error}; partial-write replay never yields dispatch_result=failed + status=pending
- `PendingRequestStore.record_internal_abort` — single-append atomicity of {status=canceled, internal_abort_reason, resolution_action=None, response_payload=None, response_dispatch_at=None, dispatch_result=None, resolved_at=None}; replay round-trips the internal_abort_reason; partial-write replay never yields internal_abort_reason set + status=pending
- Sanitization rules (§Observability): `dispatch_error` and `internal_abort_reason` strings pass through the sanitizer; verify truncation at 200 chars + `...` elision, class-name prefix, newline escaping, combined 256-char cap, warning-log on over-cap values
- `DelegationJobStore.update_parked_request` — set, then clear, then replay consistency

**Integration tests (worker thread lifecycle):**
- Worker spawn on `start()`; escalation returned before turn completes
- Worker parks on registry; MCP main thread responsive to concurrent poll
- Worker wakes on `decide()`; dispatches respond; transitions status
- Worker wakes on timeout; dispatches cancel; records timed_out
- Worker wakes on `decide()`; `session.respond()` raises `BrokenPipeError`; `record_dispatch_failure` captures forensic fields; job terminalizes as `unknown`; `poll()` returns `job.status="unknown"` (MCP-visible surface); verify forensic fields (`dispatch_result="failed"`, `dispatch_error=<sanitized>`, `resolved_at=None`) by direct `PendingRequestStore.get(rid)` inspection — `PendingEscalationView` does not carry forensic fields, so `poll()` cannot expose them.
- Timeout cancel-dispatch transport failure: worker wakes on timeout for a cancel-capable kind; `session.respond(rid, {"decision": "cancel"})` raises `BrokenPipeError`; verify `record_timeout(..., dispatch_result="failed", dispatch_error=<sanitized>)` is called; verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid)` shows `timed_out=True`, `dispatch_result="failed"`, `dispatch_error` matches sanitization format, `status="canceled"`, `interrupt_error=None` (orthogonal transport surface); verify `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` was called exactly once (handler-side); verify the handler raised `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="timeout_cancel_dispatch_failed")` (NOT a bare `return`); verify the sentinel was caught in `_execute_live_turn` and `_finalize_turn` was NOT invoked; verify `poll()` returns `job.status="unknown"` (OB-1: transport failure at timeout → unknown, not canceled-job); verify NO `announce_worker_failed` signal fired (post-capture branch).
- Timeout interrupt-transport success (non-cancel-capable kind, C1 interrupt-succeeded sub-branch): worker wakes on timeout for a `request_user_input` kind; `session.interrupt_turn(thread_id, turn_id)` returns normally; verify `record_timeout(..., interrupt_error=None)` is called; verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid)` shows `timed_out=True`, `status="canceled"`, `interrupt_error=None`; verify the worker-thread durable cleanup sequence fires in order: `_persist_job_transition(job_id, "canceled")`, `_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed(job_id)` (emits `DelegationOutcomeRecord` with `terminal_status="canceled"`), `lineage_store.update_status(collaboration_id, "completed")`, `runtime_registry.release(runtime_id)`, `entry.session.close()`; verify the handler raised `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="timeout_interrupt_succeeded")` (NOT a bare `return None`); verify the sentinel was caught in `_execute_live_turn` and `_finalize_turn` was NOT invoked (no `_verify_post_turn_signals`, no D4 `update_status` write, no kind-based reclassification); verify `poll()` returns `job.status="canceled"` (not `"unknown"`); verify NO `announce_worker_failed` signal fired (post-decide branch, no main-thread waiter).
- Timeout interrupt-transport failure (C1 interrupt-failed sub-branch): worker wakes on timeout for a non-cancel-capable kind (e.g., `request_user_input`); `session.interrupt_turn(thread_id, turn_id)` raises a transport exception (e.g., `BrokenPipeError`-wrapped `RuntimeError` or `JsonRpcError`); verify `record_timeout(..., interrupt_error=<sanitized>)` is called; verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid)` shows `timed_out=True`, `status="canceled"`, `interrupt_error` matches sanitization format (class-name prefix, 256-char cap), `dispatch_result=None`, `dispatch_error=None` (interrupt and respond are orthogonal transport surfaces); verify a warning log line recorded the interrupt failure with `job_id`, `request_id`, and sanitized cause; verify `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` was called exactly once (handler-side); verify the handler raised `_WorkerTerminalBranchSignal(reason="timeout_interrupt_failed")`; verify the sentinel was caught in `_execute_live_turn` and `_finalize_turn` was NOT invoked; verify `poll()` returns `job.status="unknown"` (NOT `"canceled"` — OB-1: unverified cancel collapses to unknown); verify NO `announce_worker_failed` signal fired (post-decide branch, no main-thread waiter).
- Worker exception during park; cleanup runs; registry entry discarded; late decide rejects via `job_not_awaiting_decision`
- Worker exception post-wake; cleanup runs; turn fails; `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` executes
- Start-wait budget elapsed with healthy slow worker: force `START_OUTCOME_WAIT_SECONDS` to elapse before the worker signals; verify `start()` returns `DelegationJob(status="running")` (not a raise); verify subsequent `poll()` observes the eventual escalation/completion/unknown outcome the worker signals later; verify the late `announce_*` call does not raise on the worker thread
- Concurrent signal-vs-budget race: induce worker `announce_parked` at the exact moment the main-thread timer synthesizes `StartWaitElapsed`; assert exactly one path resolves (Parked escalation OR running-return), never both, and durable state is consistent with whichever path won
- Parked projection invariant violation (F1): exercise both sub-cases so the broad-reason convention holds across proximate causes. **(a) Null-return sub-case:** simulate a Parked signal followed by a null projection (monkeypatch `_project_pending_escalation` to return `None`, or arrange a store race that clears the request between signal and projection). **(b) Raised-exception sub-case:** simulate a Parked signal followed by `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` (construct a parkable `PendingServerRequest` whose `kind` is later tampered to a non-escalatable literal, or monkeypatch `_project_request_to_view` to raise). In both sub-cases: verify `start()` calls `registry.signal_internal_abort(rid, "parked_projection_invariant_violation")` (NOT `"unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection"` — start() owns the broad reason regardless of proximate cause); verify `start()` raises `DelegationStartError(reason="parked_projection_invariant_violation")` (distinct from `worker_failed_before_capture`); verify the worker's abort-path wake branch runs and `poll()` eventually returns `job.status="unknown"`; verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid)` shows `internal_abort_reason="parked_projection_invariant_violation"` via direct read.
- Unknown-kind poll projection abort: construct a `PendingServerRequest` with `kind="unknown"` and a job whose `parked_request_id` points at it (e.g., a pre-Packet-1 JSONL replay); call `poll()`; verify `_project_pending_escalation` re-raises `UnknownKindInEscalationProjection` without signaling (helper is pure — assert via mock that `registry.signal_internal_abort` is NOT called from the helper); verify `poll()`'s wrapper catches the exception and calls `registry.signal_internal_abort(rid, "unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection")`; verify poll #1 returns `DelegationPollResult(pending_escalation=None)` with the CURRENT job status; verify worker's abort-path wake branch runs; verify poll #2 returns `job.status="unknown"`; verify `PendingRequestStore.get(rid)` shows `internal_abort_reason="unknown_kind_in_escalation_projection"` via direct read.
- Internal-abort CAS-loss race: main thread observes an invariant violation and calls `signal_internal_abort(rid, reason)` concurrently with a `decide()` call that wins the reservation CAS; verify `signal_internal_abort` returns `False` (no-op); verify `decide()` proceeds normally and the operator's decision commits; verify no `internal_abort_reason` is written to the store (operator path wins over abort path once durable intent is in flight).

**End-to-end tests (MCP boundary):**
- Full deferred-approval flow: MCP `codex.delegate.start` → capture → park → MCP `codex.delegate.poll` returns escalation → MCP `codex.delegate.decide` → dispatch → turn completes → final poll returns completion
- Duplicate decide: second call returns `request_already_decided`
- Poll during consuming window: MAY transiently show pending_escalation; once worker completes `status→running` transition, subsequent polls no longer surface the escalation. Test asserts the eventual state, not immediate absence.
- Cold-start recovery: plugin restart mid-park → orphan demotion → late decide rejects

**Concurrency property tests:**
- IO-1: no other thread calls `JsonRpcClient` methods while worker owns the session (introspect via mock/spy)
- IO-2: no main-thread store writes to `pending_request_store` during worker's turn (same approach)
- IO-3: single-writer-per-store under race (stress test with multiple turns)
- IO-4: not directly testable (platform invariant); documented assumption

**Observability tests:**
- OB-1: no test/assertion ever claims "decision applied" based on transport success alone
- Protocol echo: persisted tuple matches signals observed in notifications
- Timeout: `approval_timeout` audit event fires; `timed_out=True` on record; audit event payload includes `dispatch_result` (for cancel-capable paths) so analytics can distinguish succeeded vs failed dispatch at timeout
- Dispatch failure: `dispatch_failed` audit event fires; `dispatch_result="failed"` on record; `dispatch_error` set and sanitized; `resolved_at=None`; terminal `job.status="unknown"` (not `"failed"`, per OB-1 — transport failure does not mean dispatch failure from App Server's perspective)
- Internal abort: `internal_abort` audit event fires with `reason` field; `internal_abort_reason` set on record; `status="canceled"`; `resolution_action=None`; terminal `job.status="unknown"` (the plugin could not dispatch any decision, so application-side state is unknown per OB-1)

**Public contract tests (`codex.delegate.start` JSON shape + escalation-view kind narrowing):**
- Parse-failure return: `codex.delegate.start` of a delegation whose first captured request has `kind="unknown"` returns a plain `DelegationJob` JSON object with `status="unknown"`; assert the response has NO `pending_escalation` key, NO `escalated: true` marker, and NO new `outcome` field.
- Turn-completed-without-capture return: `codex.delegate.start` of a purely analytical delegation returns a plain `DelegationJob` JSON object with `status="completed"`; assert no `pending_escalation` key, no `escalated: true` marker.
- Parked return (regression): `codex.delegate.start` of a delegation with a parkable captured request returns `DelegationEscalation` JSON (`job`, `pending_escalation`, `agent_context`, `escalated=true`) — shape matches the pre-Packet-1 escalated return exactly.
- Escalation-view kind narrowing: across `codex.delegate.start` (escalated return) and `codex.delegate.poll` return paths — the two Packet 1 surfaces that can include `pending_escalation` — assert that no `pending_escalation.kind` field ever carries the string `"unknown"`. Assert separately that `codex.delegate.decide` returns the new 3-field shape (`decision_accepted`, `job_id`, `request_id`) with no `pending_escalation` key at all. Also assert via static typing (mypy/pyright) that `EscalatableRequestKind` is the only type constructible into `PendingEscalationView.kind`.
- Pre-Packet-1 regression: the `interrupted_by_unknown` control path does not surface as a `DelegationEscalation` on `start()` return. Fixture reproduces a parse-failing request; assertion confirms the pre-Packet-1 escalation projection no longer fires.

### Migration

**Data:** None required. All new `PendingServerRequest` fields have safe defaults (None or empty tuple or `False`). Existing records read as all-None / empty on new fields.

**Journal:** `completion_origin` is optional; old records without the field read as `None`. Backward-compatible.

**Job store:** `parked_request_id` optional with `None` default; existing jobs read as not parked.

**Contract:** `DelegationDecisionResult` shape change is breaking for external callers. Callers that read `pending_escalation` from decide's response must switch to `poll()` — intentional migration forcing, not an accident.

**Tests:** `test_mcp_server.py:1202` and related assertions on `decision`/`resumed` are rewritten to the new success shape.

## Rejected Alternatives (Rationale Appendix)

One rejected alternative per question from the Q1–Q7 brainstorm. Each is documented here because future readers may propose them without context.

### Q1: asyncio task + awaitable future

Rejected: would require rewriting `JsonRpcClient` (subprocess + thread-backed blocking queue reads are not awaitable), plus converting every sync caller up the stack (`_run_turn`, `run_execution_turn`, MCP dispatch) to async. The transport layer at `jsonrpc_client.py:8,35-59` is already multi-threaded via background reader threads; the worker-thread approach extends this established pattern. asyncio would be a fundamentally different concurrency model that doesn't mesh and would require a far broader refactor than Packet 1 should own.

### Q2: multi-capture collection (list or dict keyed by request_id)

Rejected: adds in-memory state for a scenario the notification-loop shape already prevents. The handler at `runtime.py:245-248` runs serially — the loop cannot call the handler for a second notification until the first handler returns. "At most one parked-and-unresolved capture at any instant" is true by construction. A collection would be dead state.

### Q2: prove single-capture-per-turn

Rejected: amendment-triggered continuation genuinely can issue further approval requests. For multi-step objectives ("edit five files"), each sandbox-violating action can trigger its own approval. This path exists in the protocol; we cannot prove it away.

### Q3: `decide()` writes to `PendingRequestStore`

Rejected: creates cross-thread store writers (`pending_request_store` would be written by both main thread in `decide()` and worker thread on wake). Breaks IO-3. Single-writer discipline is cheaper and more verifiable than store-level locking.

### Q3: extend `PendingRequestStatus` enum with a `parked` literal

Rejected: `PendingRequestStatus` tracks wire lifecycle (`pending`/`resolved`/`canceled`). Adding a plugin-runtime concept would mix two axes in one enum. The job-level field `parked_request_id` is the right place because the coordination invariant ("at most one parked request per job") is job-scoped.

### Q4: journal-local mutex for `approval_resolution` phase writes

Rejected: the journal's append-only JSONL pattern matches the stores' pattern exactly (`journal.write_phase` at `journal.py:300-307` vs. `pending_request_store._append` at `:71-75`). The existing repo relies on OS-level JSONL append atomicity (IO-4). Extending the journal to multi-writer follows the same assumption. A mutex would be inconsistent with the stores' pattern and add complexity without adding correctness.

### Q4: liveness probe (`decide()` checks thread liveness before CAS)

Rejected: adds thread introspection as a regular path operation. Option A (worker exception handler discards registry entry) is cleaner because the cleanup is already happening for the exception path — we just add one line (`registry.discard(rid)`) to the existing `_mark_execution_unknown_and_cleanup` at `:759`.

### Q5: new `DecisionRejectedReason` values

Rejected: existing values (`request_already_decided`, `job_not_awaiting_decision`, `request_not_found`, `request_job_mismatch`) already cover all Packet 1 cases at `models.py:37-47`. Adding literals without concrete need expands the contract surface unnecessarily.

### Q5: new journal phases (`abandoned`, etc.)

Rejected: would require adding to `_VALID_PHASES` and updating `_phase_rank`. More invasive than one optional field. Also ambiguous about phase ordering.

### Q6: "applied vs error" observability channel

Rejected: no such channel exists in the current protocol. `JsonRpcClient.respond()` is fire-and-forget stdin write with no ack (`jsonrpc_client.py:106-130`); nothing in the notification stream semantically reports "App Server applied your decision." The four-tier observation taxonomy captures what is honestly observable; inventing a channel we cannot verify is the rejected spec's fundamental honesty failure.

### Q6: turn-scoped `turn_observed_terminal` audit event

Rejected: already covered by `job.status` persistence plus `DelegationOutcomeRecord` via `_emit_terminal_outcome_if_needed` at `delegation_controller.py:801`. Adding a new audit event duplicates existing state. The request-scoped `protocol_echo_*` fields are the high-signal new surface for Packet 1.

### Q7: transport-derived operator window

Rejected: the ticket's framing ("operator window ≤ transport budget") is imprecise. The client-side `request_timeout` bounds our outbound requests, not the parked handler. The notification-loop timeout isn't active during the parked block (handler call blocks the loop). The true constraint is App Server's server-request timeout, which is external and unknown. The 900s default is product policy, not transport derivation.

### Q7: universal timeout→cancel rule across all request kinds

Rejected: `request_user_input`'s timeout-response contract is not pinned in the codex-app-server docs. Applying the cancel-capable pattern to it without explicit contract confirmation risks mis-dispatching. Packet 1 narrows timeout automation to kinds with unambiguous contracts; other kinds get `interrupt_turn` as safe fallback.

### Q7: `resolution_action="deny"` for synthetic timeouts

Rejected: conflates operator-fact with circumstance-fact. `resolution_action` was tightened in Q3/Q6 to mean what `decide()` specified. A timeout is not an operator deny; representing it as `action=deny` would undo the honesty cleanup. Timeout is represented on a separate axis (`timed_out: bool`).

### Q7: overloading `completion_origin` with a timeout value

Rejected: `completion_origin` tracks provenance of the terminal `approval_resolution.completed` journal marker — normal worker vs. recovery closure. Worker-driven timeout dispatch is still normal worker completion. Adding `origin_timeout_synthetic` to the field would conflate timeline provenance with dispatch circumstance. Timeout lives on the request record; `completion_origin` stays scoped to recovery.
