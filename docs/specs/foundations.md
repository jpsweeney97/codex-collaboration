# Foundations

## Scope

**codex-collaboration** is a Claude Code plugin that gives Claude a structured second-opinion lane to OpenAI Codex. It supports three capabilities across two capability classes:

| Capability | Purpose | Capability Class | Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Consultation** | One-shot second opinions | Advisory | Advisory (shared) |
| **Dialogue** | Durable, branchable multi-turn discussion | Advisory | Advisory (shared) |
| **Delegation** | Autonomous task execution in isolation | Execution | Execution (ephemeral) |

### Goals

- Give Claude a structured second-opinion lane to Codex.
- Support durable, branchable, multi-turn Claude-to-Codex dialogues.
- Support autonomous Codex task execution without weakening Claude's control.
- Acknowledge where Codex-native primitives satisfy requirements without custom control-plane machinery, and document why this spec's approach was chosen where it overlaps.
- Preserve strong trust boundaries around secrets, paths, sandboxing, and write surfaces.
- Make crash recovery and lineage explicit.
- Stay on stable App Server APIs where possible.

### Non-Goals

- Preserve compatibility with the current `cross-model` contracts. See [decisions.md §Greenfield Rules](decisions.md#greenfield-rules) for the explicit break list.
- Expose raw App Server methods to Claude.
- Depend on experimental App Server features for core flows when a stable path exists.
- Let Codex write directly into the user's primary working tree during delegation.
- Use Codex-side plugin/app discovery as a core dependency.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Capability** | One of three interaction modes: consultation, dialogue, or delegation. |
| **Capability class** | A trust category that groups related capabilities. Two classes: advisory (consultation + dialogue) and execution (delegation). Each class has a defined trust level, runtime scope, and approval boundary. |
| **Runtime domain** | The App Server process scope in which Codex operates. Advisory and execution are the two domains. |
| **Advisory domain** | A long-lived App Server runtime for consultation and dialogue. One per Claude session and repo root. See [advisory-runtime-policy.md](advisory-runtime-policy.md) for lifecycle rules. |
| **Execution domain** | An ephemeral App Server runtime for delegation. One per delegation job, always in an isolated git worktree. |
| **Policy fingerprint** | An immutable identifier for the exact policy configuration of a runtime instance. See [advisory-runtime-policy.md §Policy Fingerprint](advisory-runtime-policy.md#policy-fingerprint). |
| **Collaboration handle** | The plugin's logical identifier for a Codex interaction. Wraps raw Codex thread IDs. See [contracts.md §CollaborationHandle](contracts.md#collaborationhandle). |
| **Delegation job** | A unit of autonomous execution work. One job = one runtime = one worktree. See [contracts.md §DelegationJob](contracts.md#delegationjob). |
| **Promotion** | Applying delegation results from an isolated worktree back to the user's primary workspace. See [promotion-protocol.md](promotion-protocol.md). |
| **Operation journal** | A crash-safe, session-bounded log for idempotent replay. See [recovery-and-journal.md §Operation Journal](recovery-and-journal.md#operation-journal). |
| **Audit log** | A best-effort, TTL-based log for human reconstruction. See [recovery-and-journal.md §Audit Log](recovery-and-journal.md#audit-log). |

## Architectural Shape

The plugin uses a split-runtime model with separate App Server processes for advisory and execution work. Claude never interacts with App Server directly — a control plane mediates all requests.

```

### Why Split Runtimes

App Server supports `acceptForSession` approval scope. A single runtime for both advisory and execution work would allow session-scoped approvals to bleed across capability classes — advisory read-only work could inherit delegation-grade write permissions, or vice versa.

Separate runtimes make the session scope boundary match the trust boundary.

## Runtime Domains

### Advisory Domain

One advisory App Server runtime per Claude session and repo root. Long-lived for the session duration.

Storage: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runtimes/advisory/<claude-session-id>/`

Policy defaults:

| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| Transport | stdio only |
| Sandbox | read-only |
| Approvals | disabled |
| App connectors | disabled |
| Dynamic tools | disabled (v1) |
| File-change approvals | auto-declined |
| Network approvals | auto-declined unless explicitly requested |

Consultation and dialogue share the advisory runtime because they are the same capability class. For advisory runtime lifecycle rules, see [advisory-runtime-policy.md](advisory-runtime-policy.md). Current Packet 1 behavior is a fixed advisory posture (read-only, no-network, approvals disabled); policy widening, narrowing, and rotation are [future-scope freeze-and-rotate design](advisory-runtime-policy.md#future-scope-freeze-and-rotate-design).

### Execution Domain

One ephemeral App Server runtime per delegation job. One isolated git worktree per job.

Storage: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/runtimes/delegation/<job-id>/`

Policy defaults:

| Parameter | Default |
|---|---|
| Transport | stdio only |
| Sandbox | workspace-write inside isolated worktree only |
| Network | disabled |
| Approvals | disabled |
| Unsupported escalations | terminalize job as `unknown` (see [decisions.md §Unknown Request Kinds](decisions.md#unknown-request-kinds)) |
| App connectors | disabled |

No session-scoped approval or write state can leak between jobs. Codex never mutates the user's primary working tree directly. Claude stays primary by reviewing and promoting results after the job ends.

## Trust Model

Three nested trust boundaries enforce defense-in-depth.

### Outer Boundary: Claude Hook Guard

The Claude-side `PreToolUse` hook is the authoritative enforcement point. It sits outside the plugin, so a plugin bug cannot silently bypass it.

Responsibilities:

- Secret scanning on outgoing payloads
- Forbidden path detection
- Oversized or overbroad context rejection
- Delegation policy checks before job creation
- Explicit deny or ask decisions before the plugin MCP tool runs

The hook guard does not select or assemble context. It validates the final packet produced by the control plane and may reject or escalate it before the plugin MCP tool runs.

### Middle Boundary: Control Plane Policy Engine

The plugin MCP server validates:

- Which capability class is being requested
- Whether a runtime may be reused or must be isolated
- Whether web/network access is allowed
- Whether raw file writes are allowed
- Whether an approval may be answered automatically or must be surfaced back to Claude

### Inner Boundary: Codex Runtime Sandbox

App Server enforces sandboxing, approval semantics, and thread/session state. This is defense-in-depth, not the only barrier.

## Approval Invariant

**Session-scoped approvals never cross capability classes or delegation jobs.**

- Consult and dialogue share an advisory runtime. Advisory approvals are disabled under Packet 1 (`approval_policy="never"`, no server-request handler installed). When advisory-domain server-request handling is implemented, approvals will be per-request only — `acceptForSession` will never be applied in the advisory domain (see [advisory-runtime-policy.md §Advisory Approval Scope](advisory-runtime-policy.md#advisory-approval-scope)).
- Each delegation job gets its own runtime, so `acceptForSession` can never affect any other job.
- If a future capability needs broader access than advisory but less than full delegation, it gets its own runtime class.

## Core Flow Baselines

### Consultation

1. Claude calls `codex.consult` (see [MCP tool surface](contracts.md#mcp-tool-surface)).
2. The [hook guard](#outer-boundary-claude-hook-guard) validates the outgoing payload.
3. The control plane starts or reuses the advisory runtime.
4. The control plane starts a fresh Codex thread or forks an existing one.
5. The control plane sends `turn/start` and projects streamed items into a structured result: Codex position, evidence/citations, uncertainties, suggested follow-up branches.
6. Claude synthesizes the final answer.

### Dialogue

1. Claude calls `codex.dialogue.start`.
2. The plugin creates a root advisory thread and returns a [collaboration_id](contracts.md#collaborationhandle).
3. Follow-up turns call `codex.dialogue.reply`.
4. `codex.dialogue.read` reconstructs the linear dialogue from plugin lineage plus Codex thread history.

Dialogue is architecturally branchable. When the deferred copy-and-diverge surface lands, a new dialogue will be seedable from an existing one via `seed_from` on `codex.dialogue.start`, creating an independent linear dialogue forked at the current head of the source thread. The seeded dialogue will have its own `collaboration_id` and lifecycle; the source is unmodified. This is copy-and-diverge, not tree-structured dialogue — there is no tree traversal, reconvergence, or shared state. See [decisions.md §Dialogue Fork Scope](decisions.md#dialogue-fork-scope) for the full decision and implementation constraints.

### Delegation

1. Claude calls `codex.delegate.start`.
2. The plugin creates an isolated worktree from the current branch tip.
3. The plugin starts a fresh execution runtime bound to that worktree.
4. Codex executes autonomously inside the worktree.
5. If App Server raises a server request: supported kinds (`command_approval`, `file_change`, `request_user_input`) are parked as escalations for Claude to resolve via `codex.delegate.decide`; unsupported kinds terminalize the job as `unknown` (see [decisions.md §Unknown Request Kinds](decisions.md#unknown-request-kinds)).
6. When the job reaches `completed`, the job becomes eligible for review via `codex.delegate.poll`. Promotion eligibility requires a reviewed snapshot to exist.
7. On first `codex.delegate.poll` of a completed job, the plugin materializes the inspection artifacts, computes the reviewed artifact hash, and returns the review snapshot. See [promotion-protocol.md §Artifact Hash Integrity](promotion-protocol.md#artifact-hash-integrity).
8. Claude reviews the result.
9. If accepted, `codex.delegate.promote` applies the diff into the main workspace. See [promotion-protocol.md](promotion-protocol.md) for the promotion state machine and preconditions.

## Prompting Contract

Native Codex review and task flows exist and handle basic prompting. This contract governs the spec's structured prompt packets, which carry additional metadata such as posture, effort, and supplementary context that native flows do not express.

The plugin owns Codex-side prompt templates. Each capability builds a structured packet with:

- Objective
- Relevant repository context
- User constraints
- Safety envelope
- Expected output shape
- Capability-specific instructions

The plugin does not rely on Codex-side skills, plugin discovery, or App Server collaboration modes for core behavior in v1. The stable baseline is: explicit prompt packets plus stable thread/turn APIs.

## Context Assembly Contract

The official plugin assembles context through native app-server thread utilities. This contract applies to the spec's structured flows, which require richer assembly such as redaction, lineage injection, and profile-driven effort than native utilities provide.

The control plane owns context selection, redaction, trimming, and final packet assembly for all Codex-facing calls. The caller provides the objective, user constraints, and optional candidate references such as file paths, artifact identifiers, or promoted summary material. Candidate references are hints, not entitlements: the control plane may omit, trim, or reject them as needed to satisfy the active capability profile, budget caps, and policy rules. The hook guard remains rejection-only: it validates the final assembled packet and may reject or escalate it, but it does not participate in context selection.

### Ownership and Profiles

Context assembly uses one control-plane framework with two capability profiles:

- **Advisory profile** for consultation and dialogue in the read-only advisory runtime
- **Execution profile** for delegation in an isolated writable worktree

These profiles are filters over a shared assembly pipeline, not separate architectures. The profile determines which source categories are eligible, how packet fields are populated, and which budget caps apply.

### Source Rules

#### Source Categories

| Source category | Advisory | Execution | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| User objective | Required | Required | Caller-provided |
| User constraints and acceptance criteria | Required | Required | Caller-provided |
| Repository identity (`repo_root`, branch, HEAD) | Required | Required | Control-plane supplied |
| Worktree identity and writable scope | N/A | Required | Execution only |
| Explicit user-named files, snippets, or artifacts | Allowed | Allowed | Subject to trimming |
| Control-plane selected task-local files | Allowed | Allowed | Must be tied to the active objective |
| Broad repository discovery summaries | Allowed | Denied by default | Advisory-only category |
| Caller-promoted advisory summary material | Allowed | Allowed only if explicitly promoted | Must be summary-form only |
| Raw advisory thread history | Internal only | Denied | Not eligible for packet assembly |
| Verbatim Codex turn output | Internal only | Denied | Not eligible for packet assembly |
| Delegation result summaries, diffs, and test outputs | Allowed | Allowed when directly relevant | Subject to trimming |
| Secrets, credentials, raw tokens, or auth material | Denied | Denied | Must be redacted or omitted |
| External research material | Allowed only under widened advisory policy | Denied in v1 | Revisit if execution networking is introduced |

`Relevant repository context` is populated differently by profile. For advisory calls, it may include the minimum cited excerpts or summaries needed to ground an answer, plus broader repository context when the question is exploratory, architectural, or comparative. For execution calls, it includes only task-scoped files, directly relevant diffs or artifacts, and context required to act safely inside the isolated worktree. Broad repository discovery, exploratory narrative, and raw advisory history do not enter execution packets by default.

`Safety envelope` is also profile-specific. For advisory calls, it states the read-only sandbox, per-request approval model, network status, and explicit prohibitions on file mutation or other disallowed operations. For execution calls, it states the isolated worktree path, writable scope, network status, escalation behavior, and the rule that promotion into the primary workspace is a separate reviewed step.

Advisory material may enter execution only through explicit caller promotion of summary-form advisory conclusions. The control plane never carries advisory material into execution implicitly. Raw advisory thread history and verbatim Codex turn output are never eligible for execution packets.

### Assembly Mechanics

The assembly minimum is structural, not semantic. A packet is structurally valid if the control plane can assemble:

- Objective
- Repository identity
- Safety envelope
- Capability-specific instructions

This minimum does not guarantee that a request is adequate to run. Request adequacy, including whether a delegation objective is specific enough to act on safely, is validated elsewhere in the control plane.

Budget caps apply to the final packet actually sent to Codex. `context_size` is measured as the UTF-8 byte length of the fully assembled, redacted packet at dispatch time.

| Profile | Soft target | Hard cap |
|---|---|---|
| Advisory | 24 KiB | 48 KiB |
| Execution | 12 KiB | 24 KiB |

If the packet exceeds the soft target, the control plane trims lower-priority context before dispatch. If it still exceeds the hard cap after trimming, the call fails before Codex invocation with an explicit context-assembly rejection.

Trimming order is deterministic.

Execution trimming priority, highest to lowest:

1. Objective and user constraints
2. Repository identity and safety envelope
3. Explicit user-named file and artifact references
4. Directly relevant task files, diffs, and delegation result summaries
5. Caller-promoted advisory summary material
6. Control-plane discovered supplementary context

Advisory trimming priority, highest to lowest:

1. Objective and user constraints
2. Repository identity and safety envelope
3. Explicit user-named file and artifact references
4. Directly relevant task-local files, diffs, and delegation result summaries
5. Caller-promoted summary material
6. Broad repository discovery summaries
7. Control-plane supplementary context
8. External research material

Within a priority tier, trimming is also deterministic. Caller-provided candidates preserve caller order and trim from the end. Control-plane discovered items use a stable normalized path or artifact-identifier order and trim from the end.

## Chosen Defaults

| Topic | Default |
|---|---|
| Codex transport | App Server over stdio |
| Advisory runtime reuse | one per Claude session + repo root |
| Delegation runtime reuse | never; one per job |
| Delegation write target | isolated git worktree |
| Promotion to main workspace | explicit second step after Claude review |
| Advisory network access | off by default |
| Delegation network access | off by default |
| Codex apps/connectors | disabled by default |
| Codex-side plugin dependency | none for v1 |
| Plugin agents | optional only; not part of trust enforcement |
| Durable plugin state | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}` |
| Max concurrent delegation jobs | 1 (see [recovery-and-journal.md §Concurrency Limits](recovery-and-journal.md#concurrency-limits)) |

## Compatibility Invariants

The system fails closed if its active required contract is not met. Delivery stages compatibility checks incrementally, so the foundation distinguishes the current baseline from the expanded runtime invariant.

### Current Baseline (T1)

- A minimum Codex CLI / App Server version is pinned.
- The generated schema for that version is vendored into tests.
- Startup verifies: `codex` present and version floor met.
- Contract tests against the vendored schema verify that required stable methods exist for the pinned version.

### Expanded Runtime Invariant (Runtime Milestone R1 Onward)

- Runtime bring-up and health verification additionally verify: auth available, App Server initialize handshake succeeds, and required stable methods present via live capability probe.
- Optional methods are recorded for feature gating and do not block startup.
- Exact failure behavior for each staged check is defined in [delivery.md §Startup Checks](delivery.md#startup-checks).

The system does not rely on: WebSocket transport, dynamic tools, `plugin/list`, `plugin/read`, `plugin/install`, `plugin/uninstall`, or other experimental APIs for core functionality.
