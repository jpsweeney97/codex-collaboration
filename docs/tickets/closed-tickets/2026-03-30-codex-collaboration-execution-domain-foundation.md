## Context

Dialogue is the adoption gate. The execution domain is the completion gate.
Full spec completion and full cross-model supersession both depend on building
the execution-side infrastructure that the current package still lacks:

- isolated worktrees
- execution runtime lifecycle
- delegation job state
- approval routing
- job busy enforcement

This ticket isolates that infrastructure from the later product-facing
promotion and `/delegate` UX work.

## Problem

The normative contracts already define `DelegationJob`, `PendingServerRequest`,
and the delegate tool surface, but the current server still exposes only the
advisory tools. If execution-domain infrastructure is mixed directly into the
final `/delegate` product packet, the hard state-management problems stay
hidden until too late.

## Scope

**In scope:**

- Add execution runtime bootstrap and lifecycle supervision
- Add isolated git worktree creation and cleanup
- Add delegation job persistence and runtime/job identity mapping
- Add approval or escalation routing for execution-domain server requests
- Add `codex.delegate.start`
- Add max-1 concurrent delegation enforcement with the typed `Job Busy`
  response shape
- Add any artifact-store primitives needed to support later promotion work
- Add tests for worktree isolation, job creation, restart boundaries, and busy
  rejection

**Explicitly out of scope:**

- `codex.delegate.poll`
- `codex.delegate.decide`
- `codex.delegate.promote`
- Artifact hash verification
- Rollback
- `/delegate` skill UX
- Cross-model cutover

## Pre-Design Reconciliation: Inherited Scope-Transport Question

This packet inherits an unresolved design question from `T-20260330-04`'s v1
plan (`docs/plans/2026-04-13-t04-v1-production-dialogue-scoping-plan.md:80-107`,
specifically item §2.2.3 "Multi-agent scope-transport design"). The dialogue
path resolved its instance of the question by an architecture choice — keeping
gatherers OUTSIDE containment because they are read-only scouts (see
`packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/hooks/hooks.json:14-22`: the
`SubagentStart` lifecycle matcher is `shakedown-dialogue|dialogue-orchestrator`,
which excludes gatherers, so the containment seed is never materialized for
them).

That escape hatch does not generalize to delegation. A delegation job is a
contained execution subject by definition — its own worktree, its own runtime,
its own persisted state, its own approval path. T-05 must therefore answer the
scope-transport question for the delegation case before locking the acceptance
criteria below. The question is narrower than "general multi-agent scope
transport"; delegation handoff is a one-shot parent→child handoff at job
creation, not a coexistence problem among co-resident agents.

### Existing material to reconcile against (read first)

- `docs/superpowers/specs/codex-collaboration/contracts.md:59-73` —
  `DelegationJob` definition. **Note:** no scope field exists on the job
  today. `requested_scope` on `PendingServerRequest` (`:88`) is the shape of
  a mid-job approval ASK, not the initial allowed scope.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/codex-collaboration/promotion-protocol.md` —
  promotion-state contracts that interact with scope mutation post-creation.
- `docs/superpowers/specs/codex-collaboration/recovery-and-journal.md` —
  pending-request semantics and concurrency model.
- `packages/plugins/codex-collaboration/agents/context-gatherer-code.md:23`
  and `context-gatherer-falsifier.md:23` — the candidate-side `scope_envelope`
  schema as actually documented: `optional {allowed_roots: string[]}`. This is
  the current concrete shape, used by the dialogue gatherers as benchmark-only
  enforcement.
- `docs/benchmarks/dialogue-supersession/v1/manifest.json:53-56` — operational
  status of `scope_envelope` across baseline and candidate (baseline carries
  it in the delegation envelope; candidate gatherers support it but the slash
  skill does not pass it). Reads as evidence that the envelope concept exists
  but is not consistently wired.

### Five questions to answer before locking ACs

**0. Reference reconciliation.** Is the dialogue-side `scope_envelope` shape
adopted as the delegation job's scope descriptor, or is a different shape
required? If different, document why (likely: the envelope is prompt-time
guidance for read-only scouts; jobs need durable state-modeled scope that
survives runtime restarts and feeds approval routing). Decide this BEFORE
answering 1-4, because all four depend on the descriptor's shape.

**1. Scope authority.** What object defines a delegation job's allowed scope?
Candidates:

- Repo-root + path set on `DelegationJob` (requires adding a field to
  `contracts.md:59-73`)
- Explicit envelope passed at `codex.delegate.start`, persisted as job state
- Derivative of the parent collaboration's containment seed (couples job
  scope to caller scope)
- Some other shape

The choice determines whether `contracts.md` needs a spec update as part of
T-05. If `DelegationJob` needs an initial scope field, `contracts.md` and the
persisted job model must change together — they are not independently
revisable.

**2. Scope materialization.** How is the chosen descriptor injected into the
isolated runtime/worktree at job start? This is the core transport step.
Candidates: startup config file in the worktree, runtime-init parameter,
environment variable, hooks-side enforcement, or a combination. Must work
given that the job runs in a separate worktree and must not depend on the
parent session's containment state.

**3. Scope mutation.** Is scope immutable for the lifetime of a job, or can
it widen/narrow through approval-routing decisions? If mutable, what state
transition records the change (a new `DelegationJob` field? audit-log
entries? promotion-state interaction?). If immutable, what happens when a
`PendingServerRequest` with `requested_scope` outside the job's initial
scope arrives — block, escalate, or fail?

**4. Enforcement surface.** What actually enforces the job's scope inside the
execution runtime? Candidates: startup-config restricting allowed paths,
rewritten allowed_roots in the codex CLI invocation, guard hooks inside the
runtime, or another mechanism. Must be enforceable in the isolated worktree
without depending on the parent session's containment substrate.

### What this note is NOT

- Not a re-opening of T-04. T-04's AC-7-direct closeout stands. The
  inherited question is a forward design need, not a retroactive defect.
- Not a contract change in itself. If contracts.md needs an update for
  question 1, that update lands inside T-05's implementation — the note
  only flags that the spec gap exists.
- Not a general multi-agent scope-transport solution. Coexisting-agent
  scope coordination remains out of scope; T-05 only solves the
  parent→child handoff at job creation.

### Gating effect on Acceptance Criteria

The current AC list assumes scope is a solved problem. Once questions 0-4
are answered, the existing ACs may need:

- An additional AC ("delegation jobs receive their allowed scope via
  [chosen mechanism]")
- A modification to the existing approval-routing AC to specify
  scope-mutation handling
- A spec-update note if `contracts.md` needs the new `DelegationJob` field

Do not lock ACs until the design pass closes the five questions above.

## Design Decision: Scope-Transport Resolved (v1)

Resolved 2026-04-17 via design pass on the five pre-design questions above.

### Q0a (descriptor type): Implicit scope from infrastructure

No new `contracts.md` type. Scope for v1 is expressed by
`DelegationJob.worktree_path` plus the execution-domain sandbox defaults already
documented at `foundations.md:99-116, :228-241`. The App Server sandbox shape
(`workspaceWrite.writableRoots` plus restricted `readOnlyAccess.readableRoots`
with `includePlatformDefaults: false`) provides the verified mechanical-enforcement
substrate at `codex_app_server_protocol.v2.schemas.json:6863, :6867, :8033`.

**This is a v1 decision, not a permanent rejection of a future typed
descriptor.** If post-v1 work surfaces a need for sub-worktree path
restriction or cross-job scope policies, adding a `DelegationScope` type to
`contracts.md` is a clean additive change at that point — it is not precluded
by this decision.

**v1 approval routing does NOT compare a normalized request scope against
job scope.** The control plane preserves the request-relevant approval payload
opaquely through `PendingServerRequest.requested_scope` (`contracts.md:75-91`)
and relies on sandbox enforcement plus escalation via `codex.delegate.decide`.
Normalized request-scope comparison is deferred beyond v1.

### Resolved answers to Q1-Q4

- **Q1 (scope authority):** `DelegationJob.worktree_path` plus execution-domain
  defaults from `foundations.md`. No `contracts.md` change in T-05 scope.
- **Q2 (materialization):** At runtime start, the control plane constructs a
  `SandboxPolicy`:

  ```
  {
    type: "workspaceWrite",
    writableRoots: [worktree_path],
    readOnlyAccess: {
      type: "restricted",
      readableRoots: [worktree_path],
      includePlatformDefaults: false
    },
    networkAccess: false
  }
  ```

  Explicitly overrides the App Server schema's `readOnlyAccess` defaults —
  both the `fullAccess` default at
  `codex_app_server_protocol.v2.schemas.json:8039-8041` and the
  `includePlatformDefaults: true` default at `:6867-6870`. App Server enforces.
- **Q3 (mutation):** v1 scope is immutable as a prose rule (no typed field).
  The split-runtime architecture at `foundations.md:73, :116` prevents
  session-scoped approval state from leaking between jobs, and the
  execution-domain defaults at `foundations.md:112` disable approvals outright.
  Together these close the session-widening surface. Per-request approvals
  remain the only mutation surface.
- **Q4 (enforcement):** App Server sandbox at runtime start (primary).
  Out-of-sandbox operations produce raw server-request payloads which the
  control plane surfaces via `needs_escalation` → Claude resolves via
  `codex.delegate.decide`. No reuse of `containment_guard.py` (dialogue-specific).

### Implementation-time verification (first task under T-05 execution)

Narrow Q2/Q4 check to confirm before building the worktree + runtime plumbing:

- The execution runtime wrapper can instantiate `workspaceWrite` with
  restricted `readOnlyAccess` (including `includePlatformDefaults: false`)
  per the App Server schema. Today, `runtime.py:121-134` only constructs
  `{"type": "readOnly"}` for advisory; the execution path needs the richer
  shape.
- The approval path preserves the request-relevant payload opaquely through
  `PendingServerRequest.requested_scope: object` without shape-coercion.

### Gate released

AC-locking is unblocked by this decision. The ACs below incorporate the
modifications implied by Q0a=D.

## Amendment: Q2 `/tmp` / `$TMPDIR` exclusion (2026-04-17 follow-up)

Post-design-pass tightening identified during T-05 implementation review.
The Q2 resolution above enumerates four top-level `SandboxPolicy` fields
(`type`, `writableRoots`, `readOnlyAccess`, `networkAccess`). That
formulation was **incomplete for true worktree-only writes** because the
`WorkspaceWriteSandboxPolicy` schema defines two further fields whose
defaults widen the writable set beyond `worktree_path`:

- `excludeSlashTmp` — schema default is `false` at
  `codex_app_server_protocol.v2.schemas.json:8022`; when unset, `/tmp`
  remains writable
- `excludeTmpdirEnvVar` — schema default is `false` at
  `codex_app_server_protocol.v2.schemas.json:8026`; when unset, the path
  pointed to by `$TMPDIR` remains writable

Without overriding both, a delegation job's effective writable set is
`{worktree_path, /tmp, $TMPDIR}` rather than the `worktree_path` the Q2
resolution claimed. The amendment applies the same pattern as the
`includePlatformDefaults: false` override on the read side: App Server
sandbox defaults are permissive, and the worktree-only claim requires
explicit closure of every field whose default widens scope.

**Amended v1 execution-domain sandbox shape:**

```
{
  type: "workspaceWrite",
  writableRoots: [worktree_path],
  readOnlyAccess: {
    type: "restricted",
    readableRoots: [worktree_path],
    includePlatformDefaults: false
  },
  networkAccess: false,
  excludeSlashTmp: true,
  excludeTmpdirEnvVar: true
}
```

Q2's original four-field list stands as a historical record of the
design-pass output; this amendment updates the contract to require the
two exclusions in the execution sandbox. The sandbox-construction AC
below is amended accordingly. Branch protection sequences this doc
merge before the code restore, so the substrate will not match the
amended AC until the follow-up implementation branch lands — that
restore is what closes the gap.

**Reachability gate.** The tightening is a pre-execution-wiring
requirement. The execution-sandbox construction path is not wired into
any live flow today, so the debt is currently abstract. Any slice that
makes the execution sandbox reachable MUST restore both exclusions in
the execution sandbox construction path and its tests before any
execution-wiring slice lands.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] The codex-collaboration server can start an isolated execution runtime for
      a delegation job
- [x] The execution runtime starts with `SandboxPolicy` of type
      `workspaceWrite` restricted to the job's `worktree_path` for both writes
      and reads: `writableRoots: [worktree_path]`, `readOnlyAccess: {type:
      "restricted", readableRoots: [worktree_path], includePlatformDefaults:
      false}`, `networkAccess: false`, `excludeSlashTmp: true`,
      `excludeTmpdirEnvVar: true`. Explicitly overrides four App Server
      schema defaults that would otherwise widen the sandbox: the
      `readOnlyAccess: fullAccess` default, the `includePlatformDefaults:
      true` default, and both `excludeSlashTmp: false` and
      `excludeTmpdirEnvVar: false` defaults (which would otherwise leave
      `/tmp` and `$TMPDIR` writable)
- [x] Each delegation job owns exactly one worktree and one execution runtime
- [x] Job state is persisted strongly enough for the later promotion flow to
      inspect it
- [x] The control plane rejects a second concurrent delegation with the typed
      `Job Busy` response
- [x] Execution-domain server requests are surfaced through an approval-routing
      layer rather than being silently auto-approved — in v1, the
      request-relevant approval payload is preserved opaquely through
      `PendingServerRequest.requested_scope`; no normalized request-scope
      comparison against job scope is performed
- [x] Tests cover worktree creation, busy rejection, execution runtime
      lifecycle boundaries, and sandbox-policy construction

## Verification

- Start a delegation job and confirm it creates an isolated worktree from the
  expected base commit
- Attempt a second concurrent delegation and confirm the typed busy response
- Inspect persisted job state and runtime mapping after job creation
- Run the execution-domain unit and integration tests added in this packet

## Dependencies

This ticket depends on the shared substrate from `T-20260330-03`. It can run in
parallel with `T-20260330-04` once that substrate is stable. It must land
before `T-20260330-06`.

## Resolution

Closed 2026-04-19 (retroactive hygiene closeout during T-07 reconciliation on
2026-04-21). All 7 ACs met across 51 commits on main (`6ed5f731..271f23aa`)
and 9 merge boundaries. PR #108 was the final slice (pending-request capture,
AC 6).

This ticket's status was stale: the execution-domain foundation was fully
consumed by T-06, which closed at `541bb45f` and records 845 tests at
`85afab6b` (merge commit). T-06's resolution explicitly treats T-05 as
complete.

### Successor Concerns

Live `/delegate` smoke and reviewer/analytics cutover are T-06/T-07
successor concerns, not T-05 blockers. T-05 delivered the execution-domain
*foundation*; the product surface built on it was T-06's scope.
