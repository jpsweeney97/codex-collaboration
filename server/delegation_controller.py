"""Controller for codex.delegate.start, codex.delegate.decide, and codex.delegate.poll.

Mirrors dialogue.py::DialogueController.start three-phase discipline. Flow:

    --- Committed-start phase ---
    busy check (job_store.list_active + registry.active_runtime_ids
        + unresolved job_creation journal entries)
    resolve base commit
    compute idempotency key (claude_session_id + delegation_request_hash)
    journal Phase 1: intent (before any side effects)
    create worktree
    bootstrap execution runtime
    journal Phase 2: dispatched (runtime_id + codex_thread_id recorded)
    register runtime ownership in ExecutionRuntimeRegistry (FIRST committed-start
        write — establishes in-process ownership before any fallible local write)
    persist CollaborationHandle in LineageStore (identity/routing)
    persist DelegationJob in DelegationJobStore (job lifecycle)
    emit delegate_start audit event (BEFORE journal completed; "journal at
        dispatched" is the universal terminal state for committed-start failures)
    journal Phase 3: completed (terminal write)

    --- First-turn dispatch + capture ---
    update job status to "running"
    dispatch first execution turn with three-strategy server request handler
    post-turn status derivation (completed / needs_escalation / failed / unknown)
    if needs_escalation: emit escalation audit, return DelegationEscalation
        (runtime kept live for decide)
    if terminal: release runtime, close session, return DelegationJob
"""

# Execution-turn journaling deferral (T-05 pending-request capture slice):
#
# The first execution turn dispatched inside start() is intentionally
# unjournaled. job_creation.completed means "all durable start writes
# landed," not "turn finished." Turn dispatch happens AFTER the journal
# is terminal.
#
# Crash recovery for the first-turn window:
#
# After job_creation.completed, the journal entry IS resolved —
# list_unresolved() will NOT return it. If the process crashes after
# _persist_job_transition(job_id, "running") but before post-turn terminal writes,
# the job is persisted as "running" with no live runtime and no journal
# replay anchor. recover_startup() handles this via orphaned-active-job
# detection (see Step 6.2): any job persisted as "running" or
# "needs_escalation" after a cold restart has no live runtime (the
# registry is fresh) and is marked "unknown".
#
# Turn-dispatch journaling (with its own ``turn_dispatch`` operation and
# idempotency key per recovery-and-journal.md:49) is deferred beyond the
# poll slice. Poll operates on materialized artifacts and does not
# require turn-level replay.

        Write ordering invariant:

             (immediately after ``dispatched``) so the runtime is controllable
             in-process for any subsequent failure path. Without this, a
             failure in lineage / job / audit / completed would leave a live
             subprocess with no in-process owner and the busy gate would
             clear → same-session retry would spawn a duplicate.
          2. ``journal.write_phase(completed)`` is the LAST write. If any step
             between ``dispatched`` and ``completed`` fails, the journal stays
             at ``dispatched`` and startup reconciliation (recover_startup)
             will close the record on next session init.
          3. Audit emission happens BEFORE the completed phase so an audit
             failure leaves the journal unreconciled rather than
             terminal-but-inconsistent.

        Failure semantics (mirrors dialogue.py:361-373 committed-turn finalization,
        adapted for delegation's wider blast radius — 4-5 post-``dispatched`` local
        writes vs dialogue's 1):

        - ``worktree_manager.create_worktree`` or ``control_plane.start_execution_runtime``
          raises (before ``dispatched``): raw exception propagates. Journal may have
          an ``intent`` phase; no durable state beyond that. Covered by
          test_start_does_not_persist_durable_state_on_bootstrap_failure.

        - ``runtime_registry.register`` raises (after ``dispatched``, BEFORE any
          other committed-start write): the runtime subprocess is live but the
          in-process ownership table never received the entry. The journal is at
          ``dispatched``; no handle, job, or registry entry exists. The controller
          raises CommittedStartFinalizationError with no-retry guidance.
          Reconciliation on next session init advances the journal to ``completed``;
          the runtime subprocess is unreachable from the registry and will leak
          until the parent process exits (no in-process entry to release; teardown
          via subprocess discovery is out of scope for this slice). Structurally
          rare: register rejects only on duplicate ``runtime_id``, and ``runtime_id``
          is uuid-generated. Covered by
          test_start_raises_committed_start_finalization_error_on_register_failure.

        - ``lineage_store.create`` / ``job_store.create`` / ``journal.append_audit_event``
          / ``journal.write_phase(completed)`` raises (after ``dispatched`` AND
          successful ``register``): the start has committed — a runtime subprocess
          is live AND registered. The controller best-effort marks any already-persisted
          ``CollaborationHandle`` and ``DelegationJob`` with ``status="unknown"``,
          leaves the journal at ``dispatched`` (does NOT write ``completed``),
          retains the registry entry (the runtime stays controllable in-process for
          the rest of the session; releasing it would leak the subprocess), and
          raises CommittedStartFinalizationError with no-retry guidance. The busy
          gate consults ``registry.active_runtime_ids()`` (alongside the job store
          and unresolved journal entries) so any same-session retry is rejected.
          Recovery is deferred to DelegationController.recover_startup() on the
