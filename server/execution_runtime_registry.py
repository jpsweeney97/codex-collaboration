"""In-process live-ownership registry for execution runtimes.

Solves the orphan-runtime problem WITHIN a live control-plane process.
Does NOT provide crash durability — if the control plane dies, the registry
is lost. Crash recovery is handled by replaying:

    LineageStore        -> CollaborationHandle records (identity/routing)
    DelegationJobStore  -> DelegationJob records (job lifecycle)
    OperationJournal    -> job_creation phase records (replay safety)

Keep this file small on purpose. It is not a control plane; it is a table.

        The controller calls this as the FIRST committed-start write,
        IMMEDIATELY after ``journal.write_phase(dispatched)`` and BEFORE
        any other durable local write (lineage, job, audit, journal-completed).
        Rationale: the runtime subprocess is already live by this point, and
        the in-process registry is what makes it reachable for later turn
        dispatch, close, and crash-to-``unknown`` paths. If any subsequent
        local write fails without the runtime having been registered first,
        the subprocess is unreachable and the busy gate's registry branch
        cannot block a same-session retry — recreating the orphan-runtime
        bug. See ``DelegationController.start`` docstring and the
        ``Write ordering invariant`` block for the full rationale.

        A duplicate here indicates a programming error (two callers thinking
        they own the same ``runtime_id``). Runtime ids are uuid-generated so
        collision is structurally impossible in practice; the error surface
        is retained for test monkeypatching and defensive correctness.
