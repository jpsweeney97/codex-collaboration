"""ResolutionRegistry — in-memory cross-thread coordination for deferred-approval.

Packet 1 (T-20260423-02). The registry is the ONLY in-memory mutable state
that crosses threads (IO-2). See spec §Resolution registry +
§Transactional registry protocol.

Two independent channels per registry instance:
  - Per-request channel: awaiting → reserved → consuming (operator-decide)
    OR awaiting → aborted (internal abort). State keyed by request_id.
  - Per-job capture-ready channel: one-shot CaptureReadyEvent keyed by job_id.

Locking discipline: a single registry-wide threading.Lock guards entry state
transitions. threading.Event instances are created per-entry for worker
block-and-wake.
