# /delegate

Stateless state router for the codex-collaboration delegation lifecycle. Each invocation: determine intent, discover state from the server, route to the appropriate MCP tool, render the result, exit with next-step guidance.

**No skill-owned state files.** The server is the single source of truth for job lifecycle. `codex.status` -> `active_delegation` is the resume source.

## Scope

**In scope:** Start delegation, poll progress, approve/deny escalations, review completed work, promote to primary workspace, discard unwanted results.

**Out of scope:** Briefing enrichment, context assembly, dialogue orchestration. Those belong to the server and other skills. Do NOT port cross-model delegation features into this skill.

## Procedure

### 1. Determine repo root

Run via Bash:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel
```

If the command fails (exit code non-zero): report "Not in a git repository." and **stop**. Do NOT fall back to the current directory.

Use the output as `repo_root` for all subsequent calls.

### 2. Parse arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` using this grammar, evaluated in this exact order:

| Priority | Pattern | Intent | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Empty / no args | **Resume** | Go to step 3 (status preflight), then step 5 (resume routing) |
| 2 | `-- ` prefix | **Start** | Strip `-- `, remainder is `objective`. Go to step 4 (start routing) |
| 3 | `start ` prefix | **Start** | Strip `start `, remainder is `objective`. Go to step 4 (start routing) |
| 4 | First token is `poll` | **Poll** | Optional second token is `job_id`. Go to step 7 (poll verb) |
| 5 | First token is `approve` | **Approve** | Go to step 8 (approve verb) |
| 6 | First token is `deny` | **Deny** | Go to step 9 (deny verb) |
| 7 | First token is `promote` | **Promote** | Optional second token is `job_id`. Go to step 10 (promote verb) |
| 8 | First token is `discard` | **Discard** | Optional second token is `job_id`. Go to step 11 (discard verb) |
| 9 | Anything else | **Start** | Entire input is `objective`. Go to step 4 (start routing) |

**Disambiguation rule:** If a reserved subcommand has unexpected trailing text beyond an optional `job_id` (for `poll`, `promote`, and `discard`), or any trailing text at all (for `approve` and `deny`), **reject** with escape guidance:

> "`{word}` is a control command. To delegate an objective starting with "{word}", use `/delegate start {word} {rest}` or `/delegate -- {word} {rest}`."

Do NOT silently reinterpret ambiguous input. `promote` and `approve` must never be context-sensitive.

### 3. Status preflight

Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.status` with `repo_root`.

Check in this order:

1. **`auth_status`** -- if not `"authenticated"`: report auth remediation steps and **stop**.
2. **`errors`** -- if non-empty: report errors and **stop**.
3. **`delegation_status_error`** -- if present: report the delegation diagnostic and **stop**. Do NOT treat null `active_delegation` as "no active delegation" when `delegation_status_error` is set -- the null is caused by a recovery/query failure, not by absence of jobs.

### 4. Start routing

Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.start` with `repo_root` and `objective`.

Handle the result based on its shape:

**Normal start** (job running):
- Render `job_id` prominently, status, `base_commit`.
- Exit with: "Run `/delegate` to check progress."

**`escalated: true`** (immediate escalation):
- Enter escalation rendering (step 6c).

**`busy: true`** (attention-active job exists):
- Adopt `active_job_id` from the busy response.
- Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.poll` with `active_job_id`.
- Route via the state router (step 6).

Always render `job_id` prominently on start for debugging and explicit verb use.

### 5. Resume routing

Extract `active_delegation` from the status result (step 3).

- If `active_delegation` is null: "No active delegation. Start one with `/delegate <objective>`." **Stop.**
- If `active_delegation.attention_job_count` > 1: warn "Multiple jobs require attention ({count}). Operating on the most recent." Continue with the returned job.
- Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.poll` with `active_delegation.job_id`.
- Route via the state router (step 6).

### 6. State router

Evaluate `promotion_state` first when non-null, except: `pending` with `status != "completed"` (legacy/corrupt records where `promotion_state` defaults to `"pending"`) falls through to Tier 4 (runtime status). All other non-null `promotion_state` values are handled in their tier. Fall through to job `status` when `promotion_state` is null.

#### 6a. Tier 1 -- Terminal promotion states

Terminal states are excluded from `active_delegation`. Reachable only via explicit `promote`, `discard`, or direct `poll` with a `job_id` argument.

| `promotion_state` | Rendering |
|---|---|
| `verified` | "Promotion succeeded. {changed_files_count} files applied to primary workspace." |
| `discarded` | "Job discarded. No workspace changes." |
| `rolled_back` | "Promotion rolled back. Workspace restored to pre-promotion state." |

#### 6b. Tier 2 -- Recovery/partial promotion states

| `promotion_state` | Rendering |
|---|---|
| `rollback_needed` | "Post-apply verification failed. Rollback needed." Render verification failure details from `poll.detail`. |
| `applied` | "Diff applied but not yet verified. Partial promotion state -- may indicate crash recovery." |
| `prechecks_passed` | "Prechecks passed but apply not yet completed. May normalize to `pending` after recovery." |

#### 6c. Tier 3 -- User-decision promotion states

| `promotion_state` | Rendering |
|---|---|
| `pending` | If `status == "completed"`: render full review (step 6e). Exit with `/delegate promote` and `/delegate discard` choices. Do NOT call promote. If `status != "completed"` (legacy/corrupt state — `promotion_state` defaults to `"pending"` in legacy records): route by runtime status (Tier 4) instead. Do NOT render review ceremony for non-completed jobs. |
| `prechecks_failed` | "Previous promotion prechecks failed. Resolve the blocking condition, then retry `/delegate promote`, or `/delegate discard`." Do NOT render a specific rejection reason -- it was returned at failure time and is not persisted on the job model. |

#### 6d. Tier 4 -- Job runtime status

| `status` | Rendering |
|---|---|
| `queued` / `running` | Render job_id, status, base_commit. "Run `/delegate` to check progress." |
| `needs_escalation` | Render escalation (step 6f). |
| `canceled` | Render `poll.detail` and inspection snapshot if available. "Decision dispatch was canceled (typically a timeout or transport failure). `/delegate discard` to clear, then start a new delegation if you still need the work, or `/delegate poll {job_id}` to inspect artifacts." |
| `failed` / `unknown` | Render `poll.detail` and inspection snapshot if available. "Inspect artifacts. `/delegate discard` to clear, then start a new delegation if needed." |
| `completed` with null `promotion_state` | **Inconsistent state.** Excluded from `active_delegation` and the busy gate — reachable only via explicit `/delegate poll {job_id}`. Report: "Job completed but promotion state is missing. This is a legacy or corrupted state that cannot be promoted or discarded. Inspect artifacts manually via `/delegate poll {job_id}`. To clear, the job store entry must be resolved outside the skill." Do NOT render promote/discard choices. |

#### 6e. Review rendering (completed + pending)

Render in this order:

**1. Job metadata:**

```
Job: {job_id}
Status: completed | Promotion: pending
Base commit: {base_commit}
Artifact hash: {artifact_hash}
Reviewed at: {inspection.reviewed_at}
```

**2. Changed files** from `inspection.changed_files`:

```
Changed files ({count}):
  src/auth/handler.py
  src/auth/middleware.py
  tests/test_auth.py
```

**3. Test results** -- read `test-results.json` from `artifact_paths` via the Read tool:

- If tests recorded: summarize status (pass/fail), command, key results.
- If `not_recorded` stub: "Test results: not recorded by execution agent."

**4. Diff** -- read `full.diff` from `artifact_paths` via the Read tool:

- ~200 lines or fewer: include full diff.
- Larger: summarize per file (additions/deletions counts), show representative hunks for the most significant changes, note the artifact path for manual inspection.

The 200-line threshold is a soft heuristic for when the diff would crowd out review judgment.

**5. Claude's assessment:** Independent evaluation of correctness, risks, suspicious patterns, and missing test coverage. When the full diff is shown, evaluate whether promotion is reasonable. When the diff is summarized (large diffs), state that the assessment is based on a partial view and cannot fully evaluate promotion safety. Do NOT produce strong "promotion is reasonable" conclusions from summarized diffs.

**6. Choices:**

```
Next steps:
  /delegate promote  -- apply these changes to primary workspace
  /delegate discard  -- discard without applying
  Read specific artifact: {artifact_path}
```

#### 6f. Escalation rendering

**1. Header:** escalation kind, request_id.

**2. Requested scope** -- render per kind:

| Kind | Rendering |
|------|-----------|
| `command_approval` | Show the command being requested. |
| `file_change` | Show `grantRoot` and `reason` from `requested_scope` if non-null. File-level visibility (path, change type, diff) is not provided by the current `item/fileChange/requestApproval` wire method — approve/deny is based on worktree isolation and Gate 1 review, not per-file inspection. |
| `request_user_input` | Show what the agent is asking. Include question identifiers from `requested_scope`. |
| unknown kind | **Unreachable under Packet 1** — `unknown` requests terminalize the job before reaching `PendingEscalationView`. If encountered, treat as invariant violation: render raw `requested_scope` JSON, warn that this state is unexpected, do NOT approve or deny. Poll/inspect until the job reaches a terminal state (`unknown`, `failed`, or `canceled`), then advise `/delegate discard`. |

**3. Agent context** -- if `agent_context` is non-null, show what the agent was doing when the escalation triggered.

**4. Decision prompt:**

```
Available decisions: approve, deny
  /delegate approve  -- approve this escalation
  /delegate deny     -- deny this escalation
```

**`request_user_input` handling:** For this kind, bare `/delegate approve` is insufficient -- the server rejects approve without answers.

1. Render what the agent is asking, including question identifiers from `requested_scope`.
2. Tell the user: "Please provide your answer, then run `/delegate approve`."
3. When the user provides their answer (in conversation) and invokes `/delegate approve`: construct the `answers` parameter from the question identifiers and the user's response in conversation context. Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.decide` with `answers`.
4. If the conversation does not contain a clear answer to the rendered questions, ask the user to clarify before calling `decide`.
5. Bare `/delegate deny` works without answers for all escalation kinds.

The skill does NOT parse answer syntax from the command line. Claude mediates between the user's natural language response and the `decide` tool's structured `answers` parameter. The explicit `/delegate approve` invocation is the trigger -- the user's answer is sourced from conversation context, not from command arguments.

**Decide is accepted-for-dispatch, not applied.** `decide` returns one of:

- `DelegationDecisionResult { decision_accepted: true, job_id, request_id }` -- the plugin has committed the decision to the operation journal and signaled the worker to dispatch it. The plugin does NOT claim the App Server has applied the decision, and `decide` does NOT return `pending_escalation` or `resumed`. **Trust `decision_accepted: true` as authoritative for acceptance.**
- `DecisionRejectedResponse { rejected: true, reason, detail, ... }` -- typed rejection (see Failure Handling table; common reasons: `request_already_decided`, `runtime_unavailable`, `answers_required`, `answers_not_allowed`, `request_job_mismatch`).

**Post-decide observation flow:** `poll` is the sole observation surface for post-decide state. Between `decide()` returning and the worker completing the job's status transition, `poll()` may transiently show the pre-decide `pending_escalation` -- this is expected and not an error. To discover the next observable state (running / new escalation / terminal), call `poll(job_id)` and route the result through the state router (step 6).

**Escalation continuation:** When the user invokes the next `/delegate approve` or `/delegate deny`, Gate 2 re-runs status preflight + `poll` to surface the current `pending_escalation`. Never auto-chain decisions inside the same skill invocation -- each escalation requires an explicit user-initiated `/delegate approve|deny` invocation.

## Ceremony Gates

### Gate 1: Review-before-promote

When `/delegate promote` is invoked:

1. Run status preflight (step 3). Read `active_delegation.artifact_hash` (this is the **pre-poll** state).
2. If `active_delegation` is null or `active_delegation.job_id` does not match the target: "This job is not the active delegation. Use bare `/delegate promote` to promote the active job." Render read-only poll if a job_id was provided. Do NOT call promote.
3. Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.poll` with the job_id.
4. **If pre-poll `artifact_hash` was null:** Poll triggered materialization. Render full review (step 6e). Exit with: "Review complete. Run `/delegate promote` again to apply." Do NOT promote.
5. **If pre-poll `artifact_hash` was non-null:** Render brief confirmation: "Promoting job `{job_id}`: {changed_files_count} files, artifact hash `{hash_prefix}...`". Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.promote` with `job_id`. Render result via state router (step 6).

Promote only routes through `active_delegation`. The singleton invariant guarantees that if a job is promotable, it IS the `active_delegation`.

### Gate 2: Approve/deny requires pending escalation

1. Run status preflight (step 3). Extract `active_delegation`.
2. If no active delegation: "No active delegation." **Stop.**
3. Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.poll` with `active_delegation.job_id`.
4. If no `pending_escalation` in poll result: "No pending escalation to approve/deny." **Stop.**
5. Use `pending_escalation.request_id` for the `decide` call. Never expose or require internal request fields from the user.

### Gate 3: Never auto-promote from resume

Generic `/delegate` (no args) routes through the state router up to rendering the review and choices. It never calls `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.promote`. Promotion requires explicit `/delegate promote`.

## Verb-Specific Procedures

### Poll (`/delegate poll [job_id]`)

1. Run status preflight (step 3).
2. If `job_id` provided: use it directly. If not: extract `active_delegation.job_id` from status. If no active delegation: "No active delegation. Start one with `/delegate <objective>`." **Stop.**
3. Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.poll` with `job_id`.
4. Route via state router (step 6).

Poll is the only verb that allows inspecting arbitrary jobs outside the active delegation. This is read-only and safe.

### Approve (`/delegate approve`)

1. Execute Gate 2 (approve/deny requires pending escalation).
2. Determine escalation kind from `pending_escalation`.
3. If kind is `request_user_input`: construct `answers` from conversation context and question identifiers. If no clear answer in conversation: ask user to clarify. **Stop.**
4. Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.decide` with `job_id`, `request_id`, `"approve"`, and `answers` (if applicable).
5. On `DelegationDecisionResult { decision_accepted: true }`: execute the **post-acceptance flow** below.
6. On `DecisionRejectedResponse`: render the rejection reason and guide per the Failure Handling table.

### Deny (`/delegate deny`)

1. Execute Gate 2 (approve/deny requires pending escalation).
2. Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.decide` with `job_id`, `request_id`, `"deny"`.
3. On `DelegationDecisionResult { decision_accepted: true }`: execute the **post-acceptance flow** below.
4. On `DecisionRejectedResponse`: render the rejection reason and guide per the Failure Handling table.

### Post-acceptance flow (shared by Approve and Deny)

After `decide` returns `decision_accepted: true`, surface the next observable state via **bounded polling**. The budget is a small time window of roughly **~2 seconds total wall time, capped at 5 poll attempts** (whichever exhausts first). Trust `decision_accepted: true` as authoritative for acceptance; polling is for observation only.

1. Set the just-decided `request_id` as a suppression sentinel for this flow.
2. Poll up to 5 times within the ~2-second budget. For each attempt:
    1. Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.poll` with `job_id` (the same `job_id` passed to `decide`).
    2. **Same-request consuming window:** If the poll result has `pending_escalation` with `request_id` equal to the suppression sentinel, the worker has not yet dispatched the decision (contract: §Decide). Suppress this result -- do NOT render the just-decided escalation as a new decision prompt. Then **pause briefly (~300 ms)** before the next poll attempt -- run `sleep 0.3` via Bash. The pause is load-bearing: without it, five polls could complete inside the consuming window when MCP-call latency is fast (e.g., local dev), defeating the budget.
    3. **First different state observed:** Route the poll result through the state router (step 6). The state router will surface running, terminal (completed / failed / canceled / unknown), or a new escalation with a different `request_id`. **Stop** after rendering. Do NOT poll again.
3. **Budget exhausted (still consuming window after the 5-poll / ~2-second cap):** Render "Decision accepted -- worker is still dispatching. Run `/delegate` to check for the next state." and **Stop.**
4. **Never auto-chain a second decision.** If the state router renders a new escalation (different `request_id`), do NOT auto-invoke `decide`. A new escalation requires an explicit user-initiated `/delegate approve|deny` invocation -- each escalation re-runs Gate 2.

### Promote (`/delegate promote [job_id]`)

If `job_id` provided: pass it to Gate 1 as the target. If not: Gate 1 uses `active_delegation.job_id`. Execute Gate 1 (review-before-promote). The gate handles all routing — including the read-only path for non-active job_ids.

### Discard (`/delegate discard [job_id]`)

1. Run status preflight (step 3).
2. If `job_id` provided: use it. If not: extract `active_delegation.job_id` from status. If no active delegation: "No active delegation." **Stop.**
3. Call `mcp__plugin_codex-collaboration_codex-collaboration__codex.delegate.discard` with `job_id`.
4. If success: render terminal state via state router (step 6a).
5. If typed rejection (`job_not_discardable`): render rejection. Explain allowed states: discard accepts `promotion_state` in `{pending, prechecks_failed}`, or `status` in `{failed, unknown, canceled}` with null `promotion_state`. Post-mutation states (`applied`, `rollback_needed`) require recovery, not discard.

## Failure Handling

| Condition | Behavior |
|---|---|
| MCP tools unavailable | "codex-collaboration plugin may not be installed. Check `/mcp`." **Stop.** |
| `codex.status` fails | Report error. **Stop.** |
| Not in git repository | "Not in a git repository." **Stop.** |
| `auth_status` not `authenticated` | Report auth remediation steps. **Stop.** |
| Non-empty `errors` | Report errors. **Stop.** |
| `delegation_status_error` present | Report delegation diagnostic. **Stop.** Do NOT treat null `active_delegation` as "no active delegation." |
| No active delegation on resume | "No active delegation. Start one with `/delegate <objective>`." **Stop.** |
| `poll` returns `job_not_found` | "Job not found. It may have been cleaned up." **Stop.** |
| `start` returns `busy` | Adopt `active_job_id`. Call poll. Route via state router. |
| Artifact file unreadable (Read fails on path from `artifact_paths`) | Warn that artifacts exist but could not be read. Show available metadata. Do NOT block review -- partial information is better than none. |
| `promote` returns typed rejection | Render rejection (reason, detail, expected/actual). Guide user to resolve. |
| `decide` returns typed rejection | Render rejection reason. Guide based on reason code. |
| `discard` returns typed rejection | Render rejection. If `job_not_discardable`, explain allowed states. |
| Reserved subcommand with unexpected args | Reject with `start`/`--` escape guidance. |
