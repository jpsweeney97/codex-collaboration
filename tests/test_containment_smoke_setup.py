    """Force a per-file unlink failure during prepare_scenario's cleanup step
    and verify the smoke-setup caller logs the cleanup report to stderr with
    the ``containment_smoke_setup:`` prefix on every reported line.

    **Pins the per-file surface at the seam, not the outer boundary**: this
    test calls ``prepare_scenario`` directly and never touches ``main()`` or
    the ``__main__`` fail-fast wrapper, so it does not exercise the
    exception-to-exit conversion. That contract is pinned by
    ``test_prepare_scenario_surfaces_cleanup_enumeration_failure`` (Round 5
    subprocess) and
    ``test_prepare_scenario_main_wrapper_fail_fast_via_monkeypatched_listdir``
    (Round 6 in-process fallback via the extracted ``_run_with_wrapper()``
    testability refactor).

    Uses a **direct seam** to decouple the test from scenario choreography:
    monkeypatches ``smoke_setup._scenario_definition`` to raise a sentinel
    ``RuntimeError`` *after* the cleanup step has already run and logged.
    This tests the stable contract ("cleanup runs first, then logging
    happens, then any later failure terminates") rather than any specific
    scenario's validation path.

    The older version of this test used ``scenario_id="scope_file_remove"``
    with ``run_id=None`` to trigger a scenario-specific ``RuntimeError``,
    but that coupled the test to a single scenario's validation ordering —
    a harmless refactor that validated ``scope_file_remove`` earlier (or
    renamed the scenario) would have broken the test even if the cleanup
    wiring was still correct. See the Round 4 review resolution for the
    full rationale.

    RepoPaths is constructed directly with non-existent paths because
    ``_scenario_definition`` is stubbed and never evaluates
    ``repo_paths.file_anchors`` or ``repo_paths.scope_directories``; the
    dataclass fields only need to be ``Path`` objects to satisfy the type
    annotations at construction time.

    **fail-FAST** boundary.

    Real ``chmod 0o000`` on the shakedown directory makes ``clean_stale_files``
    raise ``OSError('clean_stale_files failed: cannot enumerate shakedown
    root. …')`` from Stage 3. That exception propagates out of
    ``prepare_scenario``, out of ``main()``, and is caught by
    ``_run_with_wrapper()`` in ``containment_smoke_setup.py`` (the Round 6
    testability refactor extracted from the ``__main__`` block), which
    prints ``"containment_smoke_setup failed: unexpected error. Got:
    <repr(exc)>"`` to stderr and raises ``SystemExit(1)``.

    This is the smoke-setup counterpart to
    ``test_subagent_start_surfaces_cleanup_enumeration_failure`` in
    ``test_containment_lifecycle.py`` — it pins smoke-setup's fail-FAST
    contract (exit ``1``, outer wrapper stderr prefix
    ``"containment_smoke_setup failed:"``) in explicit contrast to
    lifecycle's fail-OPEN contract (exit ``0``, stderr prefix
    ``"containment-lifecycle: internal error"``). Without this test, a
    regression that changes smoke-setup's wrapper exception-handling could
    ship with every other T-03 test passing — the helper-level enumeration
    tests would pass, the lifecycle boundary tests would pass, and the
    per-file smoke-setup wiring test above would pass, but smoke-setup's
    caller boundary would be unpinned. Round 5 added this test to close
    that gap.

    Coupling note (Round 5 resolution): the ``prepare`` command requires
    ``--repo-root`` for ``_repo_paths()`` validation against B1 fixture
    files (``docs/specs/contracts.md``, ``delivery.md``, ``foundations.md``,
    ``server/mcp_server.py``, etc.). The repo root is derived from the
    test file's own location via ``Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]``,
    which stays within the same filesystem-layout coupling class as the
    existing ``SCRIPT`` constant (``SCRIPT`` already uses
    ``Path(__file__).parent.parent / "scripts" / ...``). Deriving the
    repo root from the test file location is deliberately preferred over
    ``subprocess.check_output(["git", "rev-parse", ...])`` so the test
    does not introduce a new external dependency at test-setup time. If
    any B1 fixture file is moved or renamed, this test will fail with
    ``"resolve repo paths failed: required B1 fixture paths missing"`` —
    see Task 8 Step 6 diagnostic paths for the recovery procedure.

    """Platform-agnostic proof that smoke-setup's ``_run_with_wrapper``
    fail-FAST boundary converts a cleanup ``OSError`` to ``SystemExit(1)`` +
    wrapper-prefixed stderr.

    This test complements (does not replace)
    ``test_prepare_scenario_surfaces_cleanup_enumeration_failure``, which
    uses a real ``chmod 0o000`` + subprocess for the end-to-end proof. The
    subprocess test is the authoritative end-to-end proof WHEN the platform
    supports it (non-root POSIX with ``os.geteuid``); when that test SKIPs
    (root or Windows), this in-process fallback still pins the
    language-level wrapper conversion contract at
    ``containment_smoke_setup._run_with_wrapper()``.

    Parallels ``test_main_fail_open_conversion_via_monkeypatched_listdir``
    in ``test_containment_lifecycle.py`` — same pattern (monkeypatched
    ``os.listdir``, direct in-process call, ``monkeypatch.context()``
    scoping), different contract shape: fail-FAST ``SystemExit(1)`` with
    ``containment_smoke_setup failed:`` prefix, not lifecycle's fail-OPEN
    ``return 0``. Both in-process fallbacks together pin the two different
    outer-boundary contract shapes on every platform regardless of
    ``os.geteuid`` availability.

    Why this fallback requires a refactor (Round 6 resolution): lifecycle's
    fail-OPEN boundary is inside ``main()`` itself, so calling
    ``lifecycle.main()`` directly exercises it. Smoke-setup's fail-FAST
    boundary was originally in the ``__main__`` guard block — structurally
    unreachable from an in-process test. Round 6 extracted the ``__main__``
    try/except into ``smoke_setup._run_with_wrapper(argv)`` as a
    **behavior-preserving refactor** (same stderr text, same
    ``SystemExit(1)`` on exception, same happy-path
    ``SystemExit(main(argv))``). The wrapper is now callable from this
    test, closing the platform-gating gap without weakening the Round 5
    promise that a smoke-setup root-failure regression cannot ship with
    every other T-03 test passing.

    Coupling note: the ``prepare`` command requires ``--repo-root`` for
    ``_repo_paths()`` validation against B1 fixture files, so the test
    must provide a valid repo root even though the test never reaches
    ``prepare_scenario`` choreography (the monkeypatched ``os.listdir``
    raises during ``clean_stale_files`` earlier in ``prepare_scenario``).
    The repo root is derived from the test file's own location via
    ``Path(__file__).resolve().parents[1]``, staying within the same
    filesystem-layout coupling class as the existing ``SCRIPT`` constant
    and the sibling subprocess test — deepen existing coupling rather than
    broaden dependency surface.
